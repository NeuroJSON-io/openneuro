ABCD Acknowledgement: Behavioral data used in the preparation of the associated manuscript were obtained from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (abcdstudy.org), held in the NIMH Data Archive (NDA). This is a multisite, longitudinal study designed to recruit more than 10,000 children ages 9-10 and follow them over 10 years into early adulthood. The ABCD Study is supported by the National Institutes of Health and additional federal partners under award numbers U01DA041022, U01DA041028, U01DA041048, U01DA041089, U01DA041106, U01DA041117, U01DA041120, U01DA041134, U01DA041148, U01DA041156, U01DA041174, U24DA041123, and U24DA041147. A full list of supporters is available at abcdstudy.org/nih-collaborators. A listing of participating sites and a complete listing of the study investigators can be found at abcdstudy.org/principal-investigators.html.

"README":"This data collection from Yale University's Fundamentals of the Adolescent Brain (FAB) Lab contains an accelerated adult equivalent of the ABCD Study(R) neuroimaging dataset. The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) directory includes 5 sessions for each of 8 participants, spaced 1 week apart. Task-based data is excluded for one participant (sub-NDARUD216XXV) due to technical issues during scanning as well as scheduling issues (sessions >1 week apart). Event timing files unavailable for 1 subject/session/run due to E-prime error (sub-NDARJZ387ZJA, ses-02, MID, run 2).\r\n\r\nBIDS input data were converted from DICOMs using Dcm2Bids (https://github.com/cbedetti/Dcm2Bids). BIDS derivatives data were derived from the OHSU DCAN Labs ABCD-BIDS MRI processing pipeline which outputs Human Connectome Project (HCP) Minimal Preprocessing Pipelines-style data in both volume and surface spaces (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2587210, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.04.127). This collection is independent from ABCD Data Collection 2573. In addition to preprocessed data, derivatives include outputs from FSL's film_gls. See reference below for further details on derivatives generation.\r\n\r\nPublication describing the dataset: Rapuano, K.M., Conley, M.I., Juliano, A.C., Conan, G.M., Maza, M.T., Woodman, K., Martinez, S.A., Earl, E., Perrone, A., Feczko, E.
