The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory.

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order.

After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).

The experiment entailed six different conditions: maintenance in memory of 5, 6 or 7 simultaneously presented letters in the alphabetical (manipulation condition) or forward (retention condition) order. In the retention task the participants had to maintain in memory the original set as it was presented, and in the manipulation task they had to, first, mentally reorganize the letters into the alphabetical order and then maintain the result in memory. After 6.7 s delay, a letter-digit probe appeared and the participants indicated whether the probe was on the corresponding position either in the original set (retention task), or in the set resulted from the alphabetical reordering (manipulation task).
