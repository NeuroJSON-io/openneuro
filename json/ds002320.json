"README":"This dataset contains neuroimaging data collected from 82 healthy adult volunteers who underwent one session of fMRI testing at the University of Maryland, College Park. In this study, we investigated interactions between proximity, direction (approach vs. retreat), and speed during a dynamic threat-of-shock paradigm.\n\nAfter collection of T1-weighted and T2-weighted structural scans, participants completed the dynamic threat-of-shock paradigm (referred to in the dataset as “circles”). In this task, participants viewed a visual stimuli composed of two circles moving around the screen randomly. When the circles collided with each other, a highly unpleasant but not painful electric shock was delivered. The experiment included 6 runs (457 seconds each), each of which had 6 blocks. In each block, the circles appeared on the screen and moved around for 60 seconds; blocks were separated by a 15-second off period during which the screen remained blank. The raw data and timing files are provided here. \n\nPlease refer to the referenced paper for more information on methodology, analyses, and findings.",
