","i thought she was really cute with her multi faces.  i loved to hear her sounds she makes and ther little faces she makes too.  ","I was looking at my dirty couch, looking at my baby and listening to the random noises of my older child. I did get better on focusing on  the baby as the task repeated itself. ","I was happy to see my baby pop up. Surprised at the first pop up. My mind was also thinking about being still for the MRI. I was trying not to laugh at the one clip of my baby, because I remembered that she was pooping at the time! I also though about how much she looks like her father, and how much she has changed from when the clips were taken.","i FELT EXCITED TO SEE MY BABY ON THE SREEN PLAYING PEEK A BOO, i FELT HAPPY AND PROUD. i WAS STRESSED OUT AND THINKING ABOUT WANTINGTO CALM MY BABY WHEN i WATCHED THE VIDEO OF HIM CRYING.","n/a","I was remembering holding his hands to his sides and where the camera was positioned when we were doing this in my home.  I was remembering his reactions.  I was thinking some about how my voice sounded in the video.  Overall I was focused on him and how he was responding, though I had some brief thoughts about an itch on my arm and other little sensations.","I was happy to see my baby. I thought that the videos were funny. I was remembering her reaction when we filmed the clips. ","I was trying to let my emotions about the video show on my face. I also was remembering how she looked and how I felt when the video was being filmed, so those memories were triggering feelings as well as just watching the video. It was easy to stay engaged when the video was of my own baby. I was a little distracted by how my voice sounded on the video and how loud it was, and how I startled the baby during peek-a-boo.","I was thinking how happy my baby was and how I wanted her next to me.","I was thinking about how cute she was and also how I hope she's as smart as her sister. The clips of her upset made me upset and the clips of her smiling made me happy. ","I kept thinking about how the pads were very uncomfortable and then I seen my baby�s face and smile and I was completely focused on his facial expressions and how happy  he was also the bond that we share was once again reflected back to me it was very heart warming.","When my baby was crying I wanted to comfort him and when he was laughing I wanted to laugh as well. I tried to focus on something else in the video after I saw him crying a few times, because it was too much for me. I tried to focus on the blanket. Focused on the same spot each time it came on. ","how cute she was and realizing i didn't have her in clothes. i remember the day and how she reacted to me holding her hands and i was surprised watching her lack of reaction.","I felt worried and I started crying during both clips. Worried about baby being in other room by herself while in the scanner. Also felt happy when seeing clips of own baby. Got easier over time and wasn't as worried by end of it.","I was trying to decipher her feelings during those moments and in the pekaboo video i was really just laughing at her. I was also wondering how she was doing while i was in the MRI, I would say i was having a little separation anxiety lol.","i was enjoying her smiles and laughter, it made me think of how she made me feel inside","Aw, he's cute. I wonder who this other baby is. I wonder if other participants are seeing videos of my baby. This other baby is being far more responsive to the tests than my baby was. Oh are we only going to play these 4 clips? This is becoming boring.","I  was very happy to see my sweet baby.","1- trying not to fall asleep / 2- happy seeing my baby / 3- held back tears seeing my baby","I was smiling and happy that there were videos of my baby that I got to see. ","I was thinking she is sad and uncomfortable and I want to pick her up and console her. I felt uncomfortable and sad. ","I WAS RECALLING THE DAY THE VIedo was taken and remembering the day and moments. While watching my baby face, I remember her emotions and could figure out how my baby was feeling at that moment.","Thinking about how much I loved her and how I wanted to hold her. Thinking about what I have to do for the day.","Seeing my baby makes me very happy and it makes me miss her even more. Also I thought it was funny how my baby was so chill about the whole thing.

A standard 32-channel phase array birdcage coil was used to acquire data from the whole brain. Sessions began with a shimming routine to optimize signal-to-noise ratio, followed by a fast localizer scan (FISP) and Siemens Autoalign routine, a field map, then the 4 functional runs and anatomical scan. \r\n\r\n*Anatomical:* T1*-weighted 3D MPRAGE sequence, TI=1100 ms, TR=2500 ms, TE=3.41 ms, flip angle=7°, 176 sagittal slices, 1.0mm thick, 256×176 matrix, FOV=256mm.\r\n\r\n*Fieldmap:* gradient echo sequence TR=.4ms, TE=.00738 ms, deltaTE=2.46 ms, 4mm thick, 64x64x32x2 matrix.\r\n\r\n*Task:* T2-weighted gradient echo sequence, TR=2000 ms, TE=30 ms, flip angle=90°, 32 contiguous slices acquired ascending and interleaved, 4 mm thick, 64×64 voxel matrix, 226 vols per run.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Participants**\r\nMothers (n=25) of 3-month-old infants were recruited from the Women, Infants, and Children program and other community agencies serving low-income women in a midsize Pacific Northwest city. Mothers' ages ranged from 19 to 33 (M=26.4, SD=3.8). Most mothers were Caucasian (72%, 12% Latina, 8% Asian American, 8% other) and married or living with a romantic partner (88%). Although most reported some education past high school (84%), only 24% had completed college or received a graduate degree, and their median household income was between $20,000 and $29,999. For more than half of the mothers (56%), this was their first child (36% second child, 8% third child). Most infants were born on time (4% before 37 weeks and 8% after 41 weeks of pregnancy), and none had serious health problems. A vaginal delivery was reported by 56% of mothers, with 88% breastfeeding and 67% bed-sharing with their infant at the time of assessment. Over half of the mothers (52%) reported having engaged in some form of contemplative practice (mostly yoga and only 8% indicated some form of meditation), and 31% reported currently engaging in that practice. All women gave informed consent prior to participation, and all study procedures were approved by the University of Oregon Institutional Review Board.\r\n    Due to a task malfunction, participant 178's scanning session was split over two days, with the anatomical acquired in ses-01, and the field maps and tasks acquired in ses-02. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Study overview**\r\nMothers visited the lab to complete assessments at four timepoints postnatal: the first session occurred when mothers were approximately three months postnatal (T1), the second session at approximately six months postnatal (T2), the third session at approximately twelve months postnatal (T3), and the fourth and last session at approximately eighteen months postnatal (T4). MRI scans were acquired shortly after their first session (T1).  \r\n   \r\n\r\n**Asssessment data**\r\nAssessments collected during sessions include demographic, relationship, attachment, mental health, and infant-related questionnaires. For a full list of included measures and timepoints at which they were acquired, please refer to PAMD_codebook.tsv in the phenotype folder. Data has been made available and included in the phenotype folder as 'PAMD_T1_psychdata', 'PAMD_T2_psychdata', 'PAMD_T3_psychdata', 'PAMD_T4_psychdata'. To protect participants' privacy, all identifiers and questions relating to drugs or alcohol have been removed. If you would like access to drug- and alcohol-related questions, please contact the principle investigator, Dr. Heidemarie Laurent, to request access.\r\n    Assessment data will be uploaded shortly.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Post-scan ratings**\r\nAfter the scan session, mothers watched all of the infant videos and rated the infant's and their own emotional valence and intensity for each video. For valence, mothers were asked \"In this video clip, how positive or negative is your baby's emotion?\" and \"While watching this video clip, how positive or negative is your emotion?  from -100 (negative) to +100 (positive). For emotional intensity, mothers were asked \"In this video clip, how intense is your baby's emotion?\" and \"While watching this video clip, how intense is your emotion?\"\" on a scale of  0 (no intensity) to 100 (maximum intensity). Post-scan ratings are available in the phenotype folder as \"PAMD_Post-ScanRatings.\"\r\n \r\n\r\n**MRI Tasks**\r\n\r\n*Neural Reactivity to Own- and Other-Infant Affect*\r\n\r\n    File Name: task-infant \r\n\r\nApproximately three months postnatal, a graduate research assistant visited mothers’ homes to conduct a structured clinical interview and video-record the mother interacting with her infant during a peekaboo and arm-restraint task, designed to elicit positive and negative emotions, respectively. The mother and infant were face-to-face for both tasks. For the peekaboo task, the mother covered her face with her hands and said \"baby,\" then opened her hands and said \"peekaboo\" (Montague and Walker-Andrews, 2001). This continued for three minutes, or until the infant showed expressions of joy. For the arm-restraint task, the mother changed their baby's diaper and then held the infant's arms to their side for up to two minutes (Moscardino and Axia, 2006). The mother was told to keep her face neutral and not talk to her infant during this task. This procedure was repeated with a mother-infant dyad that were not included in the rest of the study to generate other-infant videos. Videos were edited to 15-second clips that showed maximum positive and negative affect. Presentation® software (Version 14.7, Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc. Berkeley, CA, www.neurobs.com) was used to present positive and negative own- and other-infant clips and rest blocks in counterbalanced order during two 7.5-minute runs. Participants were instructed to watch the videos and respond as they normally would without additional task demands. \r\n    To protect participants' and their infants' privacy, infant videos will not be made publicly available. However, the mothers' post-scan rating of their infant's, the other infant's, and their own emotional valence and intensity can be found in the phenotype folder as \"PAMD_Post-ScanRatings.\"\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n*Observing and Labeling Affective Faces*\r\n\r\n    File Name: task-affect \r\n \r\nFace stimuli were selected from a standardized set of images (Tottenham, Borscheid, Ellersten, Markus, & Nelson, 2002). Presentation Software (version 14.7, Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc., Berkeley, CA, www.neurobs.com) was used to show participants race-matched adult target faces displaying emotional expressions (positive: three happy faces; negative: one fear, one sad, one anger; two from each category were open-mouthed; one close-mouthed) and were instructed to \"observe\" or choose the correct affect label for the target image. In the observe task, subjects viewed an emotionally evocative face without making a response. During the affect-labeling task, subjects chose the correct affect label (e.g., \"scared,\" \"angry,\" \"happy,\" \"surprised\") from a pair of words shown at the bottom of the screen (Lieberman et al., 2007). Each block was preceded by a 3-second instruction screen cueing participants for the current task (\"observe\" and \"affect labeling\") and  consisted of five affective faces presented for 5 seconds each, with a 1- to 3-second jittered fixation cross between stimuli. Each run consisted of twelve blocks (six observe; six label) counterbalanced within the run and in a semi-random order of trials within blocks (no more than four in a row of positive or negative and, in the affect-labeling task, of the correct label on the right or left side). \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**.Nii to BIDs**\r\n\r\nThe raw DICOMs were anonymized and converted to BIDS format using the following procedure (for more details, seehttps://github.com/Haigler/PAMD_BIDS/). \r\n\r\n1. Deidentifying DICOMS: Batch Anonymization of the DICOMS using DicomBrowser (https://nrg.wustl.edu/software/dicom-browser/) \r\n\r\n2. Conversion to .nii and BIDS structure: Anonymized DICOMs were converted to .nii and put into BIDS structure using dicm2nii (https://github.com/xiangruili/dicm2nii). \r\n\r\n3. Converting task .m to .tsv: We converted the mat structs to .tsv for each in-scanner task. \r\n\r\n4.
