"README":"Experiment\n\nParticipants underwent a cue induced craving task (code and stimuli shared here https://osf.io/cwg9e/) after food fasting, social isolation    and baseline. On the baseline scan, participants also underwent a midbrain functional localizer task.\n\nCue Induced Craving task:\n\nParticipants viewed colored images depicting:  i) groups of individuals as they meet, talk, laugh, smile, etc.; ii) different kinds of highly palatable foods such as cake, pizza, chocolate, etc., iii) attractive flowers as the control condition.\n\nOn each trial, participants saw a single photograph and 3-5 word verbal description, for 5 sec. Each trial was followed by a 1s fixation cross period. Three consecutive trials were presented in a block of the same condition (food, social, control). Each block was followed by a jittered 2-6 second rest period. Subsequently, participants self-reported how much they were currently craving food (on food blocks) or social interaction (on social blocks) (ratings and other behavioral data shared on https://osf.io/cwg9e/) .  After control blocks, participants rated how much they liked the flower image, in order to match the demand for response preparation. A second jittered 2-6 rest period preceded the onset of the next block. In total, participants saw 18 blocks (54 trials) per condition, per scan session. The duration of the task was approximately 30 minutes – divided into 6 runs, each run had a duration of approximately 5 minutes.\n\nThe stimuli for the CIC task were tailored to each individual's preferred foods and modes of social interaction. During the initial screening, participants were asked to list their top ten favorite foods and social activities. Stock photographs illustrating these specific foods and activities were selected from a large public database (https://www.pexels.com/).\n\nFunctional localizer task:\n\nDuring the baseline session, each participant completed a functional localizer at the end of their scan. Before beginning the localizer task, participants memorized a set of 5 images depicting abstract art (all images taken from the free stock pictures site (https://www.pexels.com/)). During the task, the abstract art images served as cues to the condition of the current trial. The task had two conditions: a reward/loss condition (reward) in which participants could earn or lose money depending on whether their responses were correct and fast enough, and a non-reward condition (non-reward) in which participants always received $0 regardless of their response. Each trial started with an abstract art image. The previously memorized (familiar) images indicated a non-reward trial. Abstract art images that were not previously observed (novel) indicated a reward trial. After the cue, participants saw a number between 1-9 (excluding 5) for 100ms on the screen. Their task was to press an assigned button indicating whether the number is below or above 5 as fast as possible. Initially, correct responses were required in less than 500ms; after 10 consecutive correct answers, this window was reduced to 400ms. After they pressed the button, participants saw the outcome indicating whether they won $1 (reward trial, correct response, fast enough), lost $0.20 (reward trial, wrong response or too slow), or received $0 (non-reward trial). In total, participants played 80 trials (40 trials per condition) and the duration of the task was approx. 10 minutes.\n\nOnsets and durations are included in the individual data folders. Task specifics can be viewed in the task code on (https://osf.io/cwg9e/) .",
