"README":"# README\n\nWe present a multimodal dataset of intracranial recordings, fMRI, and eye tracking in 20 human participants \nas they watched the same movie stimulus. Intracranial recordings consist of single neurons, local field potential, \nand intracranial EEG activity recorded concurrently from depth electrodes targeting the amygdala, hippocampus, \nand medial frontal cortex while participants underwent intracranial monitoring for localization of epileptic seizures. \n\nParticipants watched an 8-min long excerpt from the video “Bang! You’re Dead” and performed a recognition memory test for movie content. \n3T fMRI activity was recorded prior to surgery in 11 of these participants while performing the same task. \nThis NWB- and BIDS-formatted dataset includes the spike times of all neurons, field potential activity, behavior, \neye tracking, electrode locations, demographics, and functional and structural MRI scans. For technical validation, \nwe provide signal quality metrics, assess eye tracking quality, behavior, the tuning of cells and high-frequency broadband power field potentials \nto familiarity and event boundaries, and show brain-wide inter-subject correlations for fMRI. \n\nThis dataset will facilitate the investigation of brain activity during movie watching, recognition memory, and the neural basis of the fMRI-BOLD signal.\n\nRelated code: https://github.com/rutishauserlab/bmovie-release-NWB-BIDS\nIntracranial recording data: https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000623\n\n",
