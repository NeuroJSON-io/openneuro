"README":"The enhanced Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland Sample (NKI-RS) is an ongoing, institutionally centered endeavor aimed at creating a large-scale (N > 1000) community sample of participants across the lifespan. Measures include a wide array of physiological and psychological assessments, genetic information, and advanced neuroimaging. Anonymized data will be publicly shared openly and prospectively (i.e., on a quarterly basis).\n\nThe National Institute of Mental Health strategic plan for advancing psychiatric neuroscience calls for increased discovery science initiatives in an effort to deliniate developmental trajectories for risk and resilience across the lifespan. Such initiatives require large, openly accessible datasets that contain sufficient detail to enable the generation and testing of multiple hypotheses. The NKI-RS is intended to help meet this need.\n\nFor this release, the participant age in the participants.tsv file is the age at enrollment, while individual session TSVs contain the age of the participant when the session data was acquired and the number of minutes elapsed since the date of enrollment.\n",
