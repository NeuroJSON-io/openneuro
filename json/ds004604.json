"README":"# Cerebrovascular Reactivity Normative Dataset\n\n## Description\n\nFifty healthy adult subjects with no prior history of neurological or psychiatric disorder were included in this dataset.\n\nThe goal is to provide a normative dataset for the computation of maps of Cerebrovascular Reactivity Maps. For this purpose, we developed CVRmap, a BIDS-compatible pipeline to process the data. More information on CVRmap can be found on the corresponding github page:\n\n`www.github.com/ln2t/cvrmap`.\n\n## Rawdata\n\n- Anatomical data: a standard T1w image was acquired for each subject.\n- Functional data: each subject underwent an fMRI scan with blocs of CO2 inhalation challenges.\n- Physiological data: breath CO2 was recorded using a capnograph during the fMRI acquisition.\n\n## Derivatives\n\n- `derivatives/fmriprep_v21.0.4`: output of fMRIPrep with the `--use-aroma` option enabled.\n- `derivatives/cvrmap_v1.0`: output of CVRmap (`www.github.com/ln2t/cvrmap`), version v1.0.\n\n## Further analysis\n\nFurther analysis can be done using the jupyter notebook in the repository `www.github.com/ln2t/cvrmap-paper`. This will produce a set of figures and perform some basic statistics on the CVR maps (age regression, grey/white matter averages, etc).\n\n",
