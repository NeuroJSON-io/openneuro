"task-mst_bold.json":{"TaskName":"MST","RepetitionTime":0.875,"TaskDescription":"Participants completed a continuous recognition version of the Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST; Kirwan & Stark, 2007; S. M. Stark, Yassa, Lacy, & Stark, 2013) while undergoing fMRI scanning. In this task, participants were shown a series of color photographs of everyday objects, one at a time. Some of the objects were only shown once (foils), some objects appeared twice (repeats), and some objects consisted of paired images that were visually and conceptually similar (lures). The use of lure items is thought to enhance interference and result in an increased need for pattern separation (Yassa & Stark, 2011). For each object shown, participants were asked to identify (by pressing one of three buttons) whether it was 'new' (if they did not remember seeing the image before), 'similar' (if they remembered seeing an image that was similar to, but not exactly the same as the present image), or 'old' (if they remembered previously seeing the exact same image). The delay between the first presentation and repeated presentation of lure or repeated objects varied with a mean lag of 19 trials. Six blocks of 108 stimuli, for a total of 648 images, were presented. Participants were required to respond within 2.5s, after which time the stimulus was replaced by a blank screen with a fixation cross for .5s followed by the next stimulus."},

"README":"Abstract\nEpisodic memory depends on the computational process of pattern separation in order to establish distinct memory representations of similar episodes. Studies of pattern separation in humans rely on mnemonic discrimination tasks, which have been shown to tax hippocampal‐dependent pattern separation. Although previous neuroimaging research has focused on hippocampal processing, little is known about how other brain regions, known to be involved in recognition memory performance, are involved in mnemonic discrimination tasks. Conversely, neuroimaging studies of pattern separation with whole‐brain coverage lack spatial resolution to localize activation to hippocampal subfields. In this study, 48 healthy young adult participants underwent whole‐brain high‐resolution functional MRI (fMRI) scanning while completing a mnemonic discrimination task. A priori region‐of‐interest analyses revealed activation patterns consistent with pattern separation in distinct hippocampal subregions, particularly in the subiculum. Connectivity analyses revealed a network of cortical regions consistent with the memory retrieval network where fMRI activation was correlated with hippocampal activation. An exploratory whole‐brain analysis revealed widespread activation differentially associated with performance of the mnemonic discrimination task. Taken together, these results suggest that a network of brain regions contribute to mnemonic discrimination performance, with the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex as a hub in the network displaying clear signals consistent with pattern separation and regions such as the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex particularly important for successful lure discrimination.",
