"README":"The study attempts to show how one can classify emotion states from acquired electroencephalographic (EEG) data, and its possible relevance to finding new methods of reducing anxiety, stress, depression, and anger management. During the study, subjects listen to voice recordings that suggest an emotional feeling and ask subjects to imagine an emotional scenario or to recall an experience in which they have felt that emotion before. The study uses 15 different emotion narratives, each of which suggest an emotion that is either of positive valence (e.g., joy, happiness) or of negative valence (e.g., sadness, anger). When the subject first begins to feel filled with the suggested emotion, they indicate this by pressing the finger pressure sensor. Subjects were instructed to \"feel\" the emotion for approximately 3-5 minutes; however, no external time cues were provided so actual time spent in each emotion following the \"feeling it\" button press vary. \r\n\r\nSubject 22 was a repeat subject, hence was removed from the dataset. Raw data has been preprocessed to fix bad event codes and remove bad channels for usability. High pass filter at 1Hz was also applied to make the data ready for running ICA.\r\n",

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion subsided.","EEGPlacementScheme":"10-20","EEGReference":"mastoids","SoftwareFilters":{"FilterDescription":{"Description":"High pass 1

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion subsided.","EEGPlacementScheme":"10-20","EEGReference":"mastoids","SoftwareFilters":{"FilterDescription":{"Description":"High pass 1 Hz"}},"PowerLineFrequency":60,"TaskName":"ImaginedEmotion","EEGChannelCount":134,"RecordingType":"continuous","RecordingDuration":4888,"SamplingFrequency":256,"EOGChannelCount":0,"ECGChannelCount":0,"EMGChannelCount":0,"SubjectArtefactDescription":"Files 1st = 200Hz changed before baseline/during initial instructions, 2nd = 256Hz.

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion subsided.","EEGPlacementScheme":"10-20","EEGReference":"mastoids","SoftwareFilters":{"FilterDescription":{"Description":"High pass 1

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion subsided.","EEGPlacementScheme":"10-20","EEGReference":"mastoids","SoftwareFilters":{"FilterDescription":{"Description":"High pass 1

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion subsided.","EEGPlacementScheme":"10-20","EEGReference":"mastoids","SoftwareFilters":{"FilterDescription":{"Description":"High pass 1

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion subsided.","EEGPlacementScheme":"10-20","EEGReference":"mastoids","SoftwareFilters":{"FilterDescription":{"Description":"High pass 1

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion subsided.","EEGPlacementScheme":"10-20","EEGReference":"mastoids","SoftwareFilters":{"FilterDescription":{"Description":"High pass 1

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion subsided.","EEGPlacementScheme":"10-20","EEGReference":"mastoids","SoftwareFilters":{"FilterDescription":{"Description":"High pass 1

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion subsided.","EEGPlacementScheme":"10-20","EEGReference":"mastoids","SoftwareFilters":{"FilterDescription":{"Description":"High pass 1

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion subsided.","EEGPlacementScheme":"10-20","EEGReference":"mastoids","SoftwareFilters":{"FilterDescription":{"Description":"High pass 1

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion subsided.","EEGPlacementScheme":"10-20","EEGReference":"mastoids","SoftwareFilters":{"FilterDescription":{"Description":"High pass 1

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion subsided.","EEGPlacementScheme":"10-20","EEGReference":"mastoids","SoftwareFilters":{"FilterDescription":{"Description":"High pass 1

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion subsided.","EEGPlacementScheme":"10-20","EEGReference":"mastoids","SoftwareFilters":{"FilterDescription":{"Description":"High pass 1

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion subsided.","EEGPlacementScheme":"10-20","EEGReference":"mastoids","SoftwareFilters":{"FilterDescription":{"Description":"High pass 1

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion subsided.","EEGPlacementScheme":"10-20","EEGReference":"mastoids","SoftwareFilters":{"FilterDescription":{"Description":"High pass 1

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion subsided.","EEGPlacementScheme":"10-20","EEGReference":"mastoids","SoftwareFilters":{"FilterDescription":{"Description":"High pass 1

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion subsided.","EEGPlacementScheme":"10-20","EEGReference":"mastoids","SoftwareFilters":{"FilterDescription":{"Description":"High pass 1

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion subsided.","EEGPlacementScheme":"10-20","EEGReference":"mastoids","SoftwareFilters":{"FilterDescription":{"Description":"High pass 1

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion subsided.","EEGPlacementScheme":"10-20","EEGReference":"mastoids","SoftwareFilters":{"FilterDescription":{"Description":"High pass 1

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion subsided.","EEGPlacementScheme":"10-20","EEGReference":"mastoids","SoftwareFilters":{"FilterDescription":{"Description":"High pass 1

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion subsided.","EEGPlacementScheme":"10-20","EEGReference":"mastoids","SoftwareFilters":{"FilterDescription":{"Description":"High pass 1

Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together.

The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion.

Now take a long slow breath, inhaling for five long, long seconds {pause for 4}, then exhaling to the same count {pause for 5 sec}. Be aware of your body, take a few moments; scan it’s every component, shifting your awareness throughout your entire being as you renew your physiological state, moving into a state of calm and relaxation.  {Pause for 10 sec} Allow your imagination to transport you away from where you are physically located, leaving the sensations of your physiological body behind you as you do. As you breathe deeply and calmly, imagine yourself lying alone on your bed in a quiet resort where you are on vacation. You are comfortable, warm and calm. Imagine a ray of sun coming through a window, gently warming your body. Let its warmth relax all the muscles in your body.  Start at your feet and calves. Notice any tension there and let it relax. Next, move up your body to your thighs and torso. Allow the stillness and warmth to radiate through your muscles and give them a sense of numbness. As you move to your chest and arms, notice once again your breathing and the slow rhythm you are creating. Remember that to focus on your breath will always bring you back to this centered and calm state. Now, release any tension in your arms and fingers. Allow them to be still and relaxed as if they were floating upwards.  Now pay particularly close attention to your neck. While keeping your head still, let your shoulders drop and feel the muscles in your neck slowly relax. Take a second to notice how this feels {short pause}. Now shift your attention to your face. Let your cheeks and jaw drop as you let all the muscles on your face relax. Notice how tension is so quickly relieved with this simple action. Remember that releasing the muscles of your face will also help to bring you back to this neutral and relaxed state. As you imagine lying on your bed, completely relaxed, take a moment to notice how your body and mind feel. This will be your neutral state to which you will return following each emotion scenario.                        ","InitialInstructions":"Initial instructions to frame the entire experience (“InitialInstructions”) sound clip #1,  “You are participating in a guided imagery task involving a set of imagined episodes. In each episode, one or more imaginary scenarios will be suggested to you. The scenarios will describe possible circumstances that could produce the suggested emotions, and bodily sensations often associated with it. Allow these suggestions to guide your imagination to imagine a scene or scenario in which you can most fully experience the suggested emotion or feeling.  Your task is quite simple. All you need to do is to close your eyes, relax your body, and then allow your mind and body to first imagine and then to experience each suggested emotion as it is presented to you. As you listen to each suggested scenario, recall how your body feels when you enter into the same emotion in real life. For example, while experiencing a given emotion you may feel like smiling or frowning, your heart may pound or your eyes fill with tears. Allow all of these things to occur in your imagination as they would naturally in real life. Because we will be recording your EEG, try to avoid actually making extreme facial movements or expressions. However, you need not worry about keeping your face rigidly still. Rather, try to experience your bodily feelings of emotion as deeply as possible through your imagination.”                                          ","FeelingItInstructionsNoButton":"{Version #1: initial button press only}  # this was used in all but the first few sessions (“FeelingItInstructionsNoButton”) sound clip #3 “During each scenario, when you first have chosen and entered into the scenario and first begin to feel filled with the suggested emotion, indicate this by pressing the finger pressure sensor once. Do it in a way that is consistent with how you are feeling. There is no need to feel the sensor move  it is quite sensitive to your touch. Then continue to dive into your imagination until you feel you have fully explored and experienced the suggested emotion.” ","FeelingItInstructionsButton":"{Version 2: repeated pressing}  # used in only a first few recording sessions (“FeelingItInstructionsButton”) sound clip #4 “During each scenario, each time you feel filled with the suggested emotion, express this by pressing the finger pressure sensor -- as if you are trying to silently express and communicate your feeling to a trusted friend or partner who can feel every detail of how you are pressing the button.  There is no need to feel the button move  it is quite sensitive to your touch. Each time you feel the suggested emotion build up in you, press the sensor again so as to again express your feeling to your imagined partner.  After each press, return to the imagined scene and to your imagined imagined emotion and bodily feelings. Allow the emotion to build up again, then express your feeling through your touch on the pressure sensor. Continue this process of diving into your imagination and feeling, then silently expressing your feeling by a pressure gesture, until you feel you have fully explored, experienced, and expressed the suggested emotion.” ","InstructionsForEnding":"Experiment description for subjects (“InstructionsForEnding”) sound clip #5  “When you feel your emotion imagination subside and are ready to return to your neutral state, press the END button to end the episode. A narrative will help you to return to your relaxed neutral state. At the end of the emotion episodes, you will be given a questionnaire designed to capture, in as much detail as possible, the nature of your experiences as best you can recall them, including any physical sensations you may have had. Please be as detailed as possible in your answers. However, do not feel compelled to state that you felt or experienced something that you did not. Just be precise and state what you did experience, as best as you can remember it. We will begin with a guided relaxation to help you achieve a stable and neutral emotional state. Thank you for participating and please try to enjoy your emotional journey.” ","ImaginationSuggestions":"Intro to emotion episodes (“ImaginationSuggestions”) sound clip #7 “Emotions are created in your mind and brain, but they act throughout your body. Because they are created in your mind, they can be re-experienced at any time. Often, vivid memories or imaginings lead us to experience strong emotions, and these emotions are often accompanied by bodily sensations. You may or may not recall dreams in which you were overwhelmed by powerful feelings. When you dream, you are experiencing a world created by your mind and brain. In a similar way, you will experience a dream-like scenario corresponding to each suggested emotion. Whether your chosen scenario is real or imagined, concrete or nebulous, the most important thing is for you to find an imagined scenario that helps YOU to fully experience the suggested emotion.”  {Go directly to first randomly selected positive emotion scenario.

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion subsided.","EEGPlacementScheme":"10-20","EEGReference":"mastoids","SoftwareFilters":{"FilterDescription":{"Description":"High pass 1

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion subsided.","EEGPlacementScheme":"10-20","EEGReference":"mastoids","SoftwareFilters":{"FilterDescription":{"Description":"High pass 1

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion subsided.","EEGPlacementScheme":"10-20","EEGReference":"mastoids","SoftwareFilters":{"FilterDescription":{"Description":"High pass 1 Hz"}},"PowerLineFrequency":60,"TaskName":"ImaginedEmotion","EEGChannelCount":180,"RecordingType":"continuous","RecordingDuration":4329,"SamplingFrequency":256,"EOGChannelCount":0,"ECGChannelCount":0,"EMGChannelCount":0,"SubjectArtefactDescription":"60Hz noise- cleared up around emotion 6.

Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Sixteen of the subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button. Eleven other subjects were asked to make pulsating button presses on a pressure sensitive key, attempting to communicate the quality of the feeling they were experiencing. Five other subjects were asked to press the button at moments when they experienced a surge in the target emotion. Results of the valence analysis reported here for the three buttonpress subgroups proved similar, so for the purposes of this report the data of all 32 subjects were considered together. Subjects were asked to experience each suggested emotion for 3-5 min, though no external time indicators were provided to the subjects, and to press a second, left-hand button when the experience of the emotion subsided.                                                                    ","TaskDescription":"Subjects were seated comfortably with eyes closed in a dimly lit room with air-tube fed ear-bud earphones. Imagination of the emotional states was encouraged and guided by a set of pre-recorded verbal suggestions. Each session began and ended with 2 min of eyes closed silent rest. The task then began with a recorded verbal explanation of the task, followed by approximately 5 min of verbal guided imagery relaxation instructions to promote a relaxed, inwardly-focused state. A series of 15 guided imagery narratives, each describing a different emotion and potential scenario, were then presented, separated by voice-guided relaxation interludes. Subjects were instructed to use whatever imagery they deemed suitable for stimulating a vivid and embodied experience of the suggested emotion, and were encouraged to pay attention to somatic sensations associated with the target emotion. Subjects were told to take as much time as they needed to recall or imagine a scenario that would induce a realistic experience of the suggested emotion. Subjects indicated the onset of the suggested emotion by pressing a right-hand button and a left-hand button was pressed when the emotion subsided.","EEGPlacementScheme":"10-20","EEGReference":"mastoids","SoftwareFilters":{"FilterDescription":{"Description":"High pass 1
