"README":"This dataset was obtained in three sessions over two days with a single subject (PM), a competitive memory champion who uses the method of loci.\n\nThe four task types were:\n1) task-loci: Walking through the (empty) loci\n2) task-encode: Given one two-digit number at a time, construct a memorable event at each locus\n3) task-recall: Recall events and corresponding numbers from most recent encoding session\n4) task-forget: Walk through loci, attempting to remove associated event from memory\n\nThe order of the scans was:\n\nSession 1 (Day 1, AM)\n1) sub-01_ses-01_task-loci_run-01_bold\n2) sub-01_ses-01_task-loci_run-02_bold\n3) sub-01_ses-01_task-encode_run-01_bold (list #1)\n4) sub-01_ses-01_task-recall_run-01_bold (list #1)\n5) sub-01_ses-01_task-recall_run-02_bold (list #1)\n6) sub-01_ses-01_task-forget_run-01_bold\n7) sub-01_ses-01_task-encode_run-02_bold (list #2)\n8) sub-01_ses-01_task-recall_run-03_bold (list #2)\n9) sub-01_ses-01_task-recall_run-04_bold (list #2)\n10) sub-01_ses-01_task-forget_run-02_bold\n\n\nSession 2 (Day 1, PM)\n1) sub-01_ses-02_task-loci_run-01_bold\n2) sub-01_ses-02_task-loci_run-02_bold\n3) sub-01_ses-02_task-encode_run-01_bold (list #3)\n4) sub-01_ses-02_task-recall_run-01_bold (list #3)\n5) sub-01_ses-02_task-encode_run-02_bold (list #3)\n6) sub-01_ses-02_task-recall_run-02_bold (list #3)\n7) sub-01_ses-02_task-recall_run-03_bold (list #3)\n8) sub-01_ses-02_task-forget_run-01_bold\n\n\nSession 3 (Day 2, AM)\n1) sub-01_ses-03_task-loci_run-01_bold\n2) sub-01_ses-03_task-loci_run-02_bold\n3) sub-01_ses-03_task-encode_run-01_bold (list #4)\n4) sub-01_ses-03_task-recall_run-01_bold (list #4)\n5) sub-01_ses-03_task-recall_run-02_bold (list #4)\n6) sub-01_ses-03_task-forget_run-01_bold\n7) sub-01_ses-03_task-encode_run-02_bold (list #5)\n8) sub-01_ses-03_task-recall_run-03_bold (list #5)\n9) sub-01_ses-03_task-recall_run-04_bold (list #5)\n10) sub-01_ses-03_task-forget_run-02_bold\n",
