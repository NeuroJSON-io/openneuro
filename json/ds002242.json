Stark, Yassa, Lacy, & Stark, 2013) while undergoing fMRI scanning. The paradigm involved three phases: Study, Test1, and Test2. Study phase: In the initial encoding phase, participants were shown 200 images of everyday objects and were instructed to indicate via button press whether each object is typically encountered indoors or outdoors. Each stimulus was preceded by a fixation cross for 500 ms, then presented for 3500 ms across one continuous block. For all phases of the experiment, 16 blank trials were added in a pseudo-random fashion to create jitter in stimulus timing, with care taken to ensure that each block contained an equal number of blank trials (when applicable). These blank trails, in addition to the inter-stimulus fixation crosses, served as the baseline condition in the single subject regression analysis. Test1 phase: Participants were shown 100 Target stimuli (items identical to the original stimuli in the Study phase), and 100 Lure stimuli (items which were similar to, but differed visually from, the original items) one at a time in the center of the screen. Participants were instructed to indicate via button press whether each stimulus was the “same” (an exact repeat, or Target) or “different” (a related Lure) to the study item. Stimuli were presented in a randomized order for both type (Target/Lure) and for level of Target-Lure similarity. The Test1 phase was conducted in two blocks of 100 stimuli each (50 Target, 50 Lure), where each stimulus was presented for 3500 ms and preceded by a fixation cross for 500 ms. Test2 phase: In this phase, all stimuli from the Study phase (Targets), accompanied with the similar item (Lure), were presented side-by-side to the participant in a two-alternative forced-choice format. The stimuli were counterbalanced for whether the Target appeared on the Left or Right. Participants were asked to indicate which of the two items they had seen during the Study phase (Left or Right) and their confidence in their decision (Very or Somewhat) via one of four potential response options (left very confident; left somewhat confident; right somewhat confident; right very confident). This phase was conducted in four blocks of 50 stimuli in an attempt to combat participant fatigue. Each stimulus was presented for 5000 ms and preceded by a fixation cross for 500 ms. During all phases of this experiment, participants were instructed to respond while the stimulus was presented on the screen, and no feedback was given relating to participant performance."},

"README":"Correcting False Memories: The Effect of Mnemonic Generalization on Original Memory Traces\r\n\nABSTRACT\nFalse memories are a common occurrence but the impact of misremembering on the original memory trace is ill-described. While the original memory may be rewritten, it is also possible for a second false memory to exist concurrently with the original, and if a false memory exists concurrently then recovery of the original information should be possible. This study investigates first, whether false recognition overwrites the original memory representation using a mnemonic discrimination task, and second, which neural processes are involved in recovering the original memory following a false memory. Thirty-five healthy, young adults performed multiple recognition memory tests, where the design of the experiment induced participants to make memory errors in the first recognition memory test and then allowed us to determine whether the memory error would be corrected in the second test session. FMRI signal associated with the encoding and retrieval processes during the experiment were investigated in order to determine the important regions for false memory correction. We found that false memories do not overwrite the original trace in all instances, as recovery of the original information was possible. Critically, we determined that recovery of the original information was dependent on higher-order processes during the formation of the false memory during the first test, and not on processing at the time of encoding or the second test episode.\n\nMRI METHODS\nFunctional and structural images were acquired on a Siemens TIM Trio 3T MRI scanner utilizing the 32-channel head coil. Participants contributed a T1-weighted scan, a high-resolution T2-weighted scan, and a series of functional T2*-weighted scans as described below. Standard-resolution structural images were acquired using a T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence with the following parameters: TR = 1900 ms, TE = 2.26 ms, flip angle = 9°, FoV = 218 × 250, voxel size = 0.97 × 0.97 × 1 mm, slices = 176 interleaved. High-resolution structural images were acquired using a T2-weighted sequence with the following parameters: TR = 8020 ms, TE = 80 ms, flip angle = 150°, FoV = 150 × 150 mm, voxel size = 0.4 × 0.4 × 2 mm, slices = 30 interleaved. The T2 data were acquired perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus. High-resolution multi-band echo-planar images were acquired with a T2*-weighted pulse sequence with the following parameters: Multi-band factor = 8, TR = 875 ms, TE = 43.6 ms, flip angle = 55°, FoV = 180 × 180 mm, voxel size = 1.8 mm3, slices = 72 interleaved. This sequence was aligned parallel with the long axis of the hippocampus, and the first 11 TRs were discarded in order to allow for T1 equilibration. ",
