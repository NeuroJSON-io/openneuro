"README":"Here we present an open dataset of 33 fibromyalgia female patients and 33 paired healthy controls recruited from a Mexican population. Dataset includes MRI data that consists of: T1w, T2w, resting state fMRI and task-fMRI sequences. The task was an emotion processing and regulation task based on visual stimuli (pictures). The MRI data consists of raw data in BIDS format.\n\nThe demographic, clinical, and behavioral data is available at Zenodo: http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6554870",
