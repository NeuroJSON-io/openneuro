"README":"# Game of Thrones - A naturalistic viewing dataset\n\n## Overview\nThis dataset contains fMRI movie-watching and category localiser data in 28\ndevelopmental prosopagnosics and 45 neurologically healthy controls.\nParticipants are additionally grouped by their familiarity with the Game of\nThrones television series.\n\nIn movie-watching scans, participants passively viewed a series of short\naudiovisual clips (ranging from 50 to 117 s duration; total duration =\n12 min 58 s) taken from the Game of Thrones television series.\n\nIn category localiser scans, participants viewed images of faces, scenes, and\nphase scrambled versions of the face images. These can be used to define face\nand scene selective regions of interest.\n\n> Please refer to the folloiwng paper when using this dataset:\n>\n> Noad, K., Watson, D.M., Andrews, T.J. (In review). Natural viewing reveals an\n> extended network of regions for familiar faces that is disrupted in\n> developmental prosopagnosia.\n\n\n## Data Contents\n* `participants.tsv` - List of subject IDs in control and developmental\n  prosopagnosic groups, along with whether they were familiar or unfamiliar\n  with Game of Thrones.\n\n* `slice_timings.tsv`, `fsl_slice_timings.txt` - Slice timings for functional\n  scans. The TSV file gives the times in milliseconds, and the text file gives\n  the times in normalised units of the TR suitable for entering into FEAT.\n\n  > Scans were acquired with the HCP/CMRR multiband sequence. More information\n  > on slices timings can be found at:\n  > https://wiki.humanconnectome.org/download/attachments/40534057/CMRR_MB_Slice_Order.pdf\n\n* `behavioural_measures.tsv` - Scores on PI20, CFMT, and Game of Thrones quiz\n  tasks (see below for more details). PI20 scores are out of 100. CFMT scores\n  are given as percentage accuracies. Quiz scores are given as percentage\n  accuracies over all questions as well as broken down by face, scene, and\n  narrative questions.\n\n* `Subject Directories` - MRI data directories for each subject:\n  - `anat` - T1 anatomical images\n  - `fmap` - Magnitude and phase difference fieldmap images\n  - `func` - Movie-watching (Game of Thrones) and category localiser data\n\n\n## Behavioural Measures\nWe provide two measures of face processing ability (PI20 and CFMT) and a quiz\nassessing familiarity with the Game of Thrones TV series. All participants\ncompleted the Game of Thrones quiz, and all developmental prosopagnosics\ncompleted the PI20 and CFMT assessments. Approximately half of the control\nsubjects also completed the CFMT.\n\n* `PI20` - 20-item prosopagnosia index, used as initial screening for\n  developmental prosopagnosia. All developmental prosopagnosic participants\n  comleted this.\n  \n  > Reference: Shah et al. (2015), Royal Society Open Science, 2(150305), 1-6.\n\n\n* `CFMT` - Cambridge Face Memory Test, used as secondary screening for\n  developmental prosopagnosia. All developmentral prosopagnosic participants\n  and approximately half of the control participants completed this.\n  \n  > Reference: Duchaine & Nakayama (2006), Neuropsychologia, 44(4), 576-585.\n\n\n* `Game of Thrones Quiz` - We developed this quiz to assess familiarity with\n  the Game of Thrones television series. All participants completed this quiz.\n  The quiz comprised 3 types of questions:\n  * **Face** questions presented participants with a picture of a character,\n    and participants had to provide a name or some defining biographical\n    information for that character (e.g., \"Jon Snow\").\n  * **Scene** questions similarly presented participants with a picture of a\n    scene from the show and participants had to name or provide some details of\n    the location (e.g, \"King's Landing\").\n  * **Narrative** questions were 4-option multiple choice questions about key\n    elements of the Game of Thrones story. For example, \"Which character was\n    Lord of Winterfell and was beheaded at the end of Season 1 - A) Daenerys\n    Targaryen, B) Jon Snow, C) Ned Stark, or D) Tyrion Lannister?\"\n\n\n## Notes\n* sub-DP15 is missing category localiser and fieldmap scans due to time\n  constraints during the scanning session.\n\n",
