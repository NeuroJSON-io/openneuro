The inconsistent individuals performed two or four same-valence behaviors, followed by two behaviors of the opposite valence. Participants gave trustworthiness ratings for every behavior on a scale from 1-7 (where 1=least trustworthy, 7=most trustworthy).","Acknowledgments":"We would like to thank Catherine Kim, Arturo Balaguer, Emma Alai, Mariel Kronitz, and Mookie Manalili for assistance with data collection.","HowToAcknowledge":"","Funding":["JTF","NSF","NIH"],"BIDSVersion":"1.2.2","License":"CC0","ReferencesAndLinks":[],"Authors":["Minjae Kim","Peter Mende-Siedlecki","Stefano Anzellotti","Liane Young"],"DatasetDOI":"10.18112/openneuro.ds002793.v1.0.1","Acknowledgements":"We would like to thank Emma Alai, Arturo Balaguer, Catherine Kim, Mariel Kronitz, and Mookie Manalili for assistance with data collection."},
