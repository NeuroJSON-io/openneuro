"README":"The functional MRI data were acquired as read out to understand targeted neuromodulation of the pain circuits in an MR guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) system. We provide two fMRI data types using different stimulus paradigms i.e., two and three-stimulus condition EPI data 1) Heat & Heat+FUS (Four subjects twenty-seven runs). FUS was applied to the VPL nuclei located in the Thalamus during simultaneous Heat+FUS and FUS only conditions where total acquisition time was 674 and 996 seconds for the two (sub-01-03) and three-condition data (sub-04/05). Alternate Heat and Heat+FUS was presented in the former data set for 16s followed by 30s rest. Stimulus on time for both conditions are Heat: 30 122 214 306 398 490 582sec and Heat+FUS: 76 168 260 352 444 536 628sec. However, 3-conditions data was acquired using a randomized stimulus paradigm where stimulus presentation timings are as follows. Heat: 30 168 398 490 628 812 858sec., Heat+FUS: 76 260 306 444 674 766 904sec. and FUS: 122 214 352 536 582 720 950sec. With TR = 2.0secs an ascending and interleaved slice timing acquisition protocol was followed to acquire EPI data. Uploaded datasets undergone basic pre-processing steps of motion and slice-timing correction as described below with registration steps for group level analysis.\n \nProcessing pipeline (Registration and normalization to NMT2.0 template):\n1.\tMotion and slice time correction (mcflirt and slicetimer:) perform using FSL.\n\n2.\tRegister subject anatomic (High-resolution T1 weighted) image to median fMRI image and save registered anatomic image at native resolution.\n\n3.\tEach functional run is then registered to anatomic image (flirt).\n\n4.\tAnatomic image is then registered to template (non-rigid using fnirt in 2 steps affine transformation matrix estimated using flirt) and warping is applied to the 4D data sets. An ANTs alternative is also used for non-rigid registration.\n",
