"README":"This dataset contains resting state data collected using a multiband, multiecho simultaneous pseudocontinous ASL (pCASL) and BOLD acquisition. Additional information regarding the sequence is as follows:\n\nThe sequence consists of an unbalanced pseudo-continuous ASL (pCASL) tagging module, followed by a post labeling delay period (PLD). Following the PLD, a multiband excitation and multi-echo, gradient-echo EPI readout was implemented. Blipped-CAIPI was also applied to reduce g-factor noise amplification caused by the slice-unaliasing in MB imaging. Each echo in the multi-echo acquisition was obtained consecutively as part of one shot. The last repetition is the M0 image collected for quantification of CBF.\nEach subject underwent one resting-state MBME ASL/BOLD scan, which utilized an unbalanced pCASL labeling scheme with labeling time=1.5 s and PLD=1.0 s. A partial k-space acquisition was employed with 20 overscan lines. To keep the later TEs within reasonable ranges and reduce total readout time, in-plane acceleration was employed with R=2. Additional parameters for the MBME ASL/BOLD run were as follows: number of echoes=4, TE=9.1, 25, 39.6, 54.3 ms, TR=3.5 s, MB-factor=4, number of excitations=9 (total slices=9×4=36), FOV=240 mm, resolution=3×3×3 mm, FA=90°, RF pulse width=6400 ms. Scans lasted 644 seconds resulting in 167 acquisitions excluding calibration reps. Subjects were instructed to lie awake with their eyes closed.\n\n### Comments added by Openfmri Curators ###\n===========================================\n\nGeneral Comments\n----------------\n\n\nDefacing\n--------\nPydeface was used on all anatomical images to ensure deindentification of subjects.
