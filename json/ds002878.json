"README":"Participants worked on a modified version of a soccer decision-making task (Fink et al., 2018; Fink et al., 2019; Rominger, Memmert et al., 2020). Each trial started with a jittered rest period (fixation cross, 4s to 10s) followed by the period of watching, where brief video clips of a real soccer game situation were presented (between 2s to 12s length; see Figure 1). The stop of the soccer scene (encoding/watching period) marked the beginning of the explicit and predefined idea generation and elaboration period. The last scene of the video clip was frozen and players of the attacking team were labeled with a number. Participants were instructed to imagine themselves as the acting player of the attacking team, and to generate a move that would most probably lead to a goal. Participants had to press a button as soon as they had thought of a creative solution/move (max. 15s). Then, during a fixed verbal response period of 10s, they had to vocalize the imagined move briefly (e.g., pass to 3, then shot by 5, etc.). Participants were instructed to name only one solution per response interval. The oral responses were recorded and transcribed for further analyses. In total, 41 items were presented in randomized order.\n\nFink, A., Bay, J. U., Koschutnig, K., Prettenthaler, K., Rominger, C., Benedek, M., . . . Memmert, D. (2019).
