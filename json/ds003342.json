Hand-selective visual regions represent how to grasp 3D tools for use: brain decoding during real actions. bioRxiv. doi: 10.1101/2020.10.14.339606\n\nDataset Description\n========================\nThis dataset accompanies work reported in https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.14.339606v1, consisting of structural/functional MRI acquisitions for 19 participants during independent real action and visual localiser sessions.\n\nThe /derivates directory contains Region of Interest (ROI) definitions in BrainVoyager compatible .voi files.\n\nOSF Materials\n=======================\nFor stimulus models of 3D-printable object (.stl): https://osf.io/r5x8a/\nFor localiser picture stimuli please see Stefania Bracci et al.'s repository: https://osf.io/98rxh/\nFor ROI Decoding Accuracies: https://osf.io/r5x8a/\n\nCode Repositories\n=======================\nStimulation code for the action experiment: https://osf.io/r5x8a/\nStimulation code for the localiser experiment: https://osf.io/r5x8a/\nAnalysis code for ROI Multivoxel Pattern Analysis (MVPA): https://osf.io/r5x8a/\nAnalysis code for Searchlight MVPA: https://osf.io/r5x8a/\nBIDS conversion code: https://github.com/ethanknights/BIDSConvert_HandSelectiveCortex\n\nRun Exclusion\n=====================\nDue to participant errors that were identified during offline video screening, these 2 runs should be excluded from analysis:\n- sub-DT12_ses-action_task-grasp_run1.nii.gz (Hand errors throughout)\n- sub-KH02_ses-action_task-grasp_run1.nii.gz (Eye errors throughout)\n\nInconsistent Parameters\n=======================\nSlightly different aquisition parameters were used for the following participants: \n- sub-ST28_ses-action_task-grasp_run1.nii.gz contains 2 extra volumes (6300 vs. standard 6230) meaning the final 70 volumes (2*35 slices) should be discarded.\n- sub-DT12_ses-localiser_task-localiser_run*.nii.gz \n\nBIDS Conversion\n=======================\nConverted with dcm2bids 0.4.0.1 (fork at https://github.com/jooh/Dcm2Bids)\n\nContact\n=======================\nCorresponding author: Stephanie Rossit; https://www.stephanierossit.com/contact\nAdditional contact: Ethan Knights; http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/Ethan.Knights/\n",
