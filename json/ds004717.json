"README":"This dataset includes raw neuroimaging data from the \"Utilizing Amide Proton Transfer Technique to Characterize Diffuse Gliomas Based on WHO 2021 Classification of CNS Tumors\" study, collected at Federal Neurosurgical Center, Novosibirsk, Russia. \nData were collected in 2023. Participants were adults with diagnosed diffuse brain gliomas. Protocol details can be found at https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2023.08.24.23294427v1.\nMRI data were collected before surgery.  \nScanning involved pre- and post-contrast 3D_TFE, 3D_T2w, 3D-FLAIR, SWI, ASL, APT, and DWI.  Anatomical scans were defaced using pydeface. \n",
