"README":"# NIMH METeR (Multi-Echo Test-Retest)\n\nThis dataset has been collected to test reliability of multi-echo processing pipelines for resting-state functional connectivity.  \nThis release includes 32 runs of resting state fMRI collected from 5 participants over 10 sessions. Subjects 24563, 24573, and 24718 (sessions 1 and 2) have two 10 minute scans collected in each of two sessions. Subjects 24740 (and 24718, session 3) have single sessions with 3 10 minute scans, followed by a 15 minute break outside the scanner, followed by 3 more scans, in order to simulate a multi-session data collection in a single session.  \n\n",
