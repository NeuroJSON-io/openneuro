"README":"This dataset is described in the following articles:\n\"Lee, H. & Chen, J. (2022a). Predicting memory from the network structure of naturalistic events. Nature Communications, 13, 4235\"\n\"Lee, H. & Chen, J. (2022b). A generalized cortical activity pattern at internally-generated mental context boundaries during unguided narrative recall. eLife, 11, e73693\"\n\"Lee, H., Chen, J., & Hasson, U. (2022). A functional neuroimaging dataset acquired during naturalistic movie watching and narrated recall of a series of short cinematic films. Data in Brief, 108788\"\n\nTwenty 8-35 year old subjects with normal or corrected-to-normal vision participated. \nThey lay in a Skyra 3T scanner with a mirror on the head coil reflecting projected stimuli. \n\nIn Lee & Chen (2022a, 2022b), subjects 3, 4, 5, 6, and 15 were not analyzed due to excessive motion.\nOne additional subject's data was collected but not uploaded as the subject had difficulty hearing during movie watching.\n\nTask 1: Movie watching\nSubjects watch 10 short films, ~50 minutes total. The movie watching task was split into two parts (5 movies each). \nEach part started with a short (~40 s) cartoon introduction clip.\n\nTask 2: Free spoken recall\nWith no prompts, subjects describe aloud everything they can remember from the films.\n\nThere was no intervening task between the two tasks.\nSubjects 8, 10, 15, 16, and 18 had two scanning runs for the recall task, \neither because they had to take a break or the duration of the scanning run exceeded the scanner limit (35 minutes).\n\nDue to copyright issues, we are not uploading the movie video files. \nDetailed information about the movie stimuli can be found in Lee & Chen (2022a).\n\nThe movie onset timestamps in the annotation .xlsx files (provided as additional files) are dependent on the human annotator's subjective perception; some movie transitions are not punctate (e.g., there may be a few seconds of black screen at the beginning or end, which is indistinguishable from the title scenes).",

the last movie that I saw was kind of a weird one.","That was, it almost reminded me of a Stephen King kind of thing.","Like this guy, he was standing on the street waiting for a bus, and this frantic woman came up to him and approached him, you know something's obviously wrong.","I thought you know maybe some kind of domestic violence situation or something because she was really frantic, and she was so frantic she didn't even put her truck in parking, it's like rolling away.","She runs up to him and she's got to use his phone, ","and she takes his phone and she's screaming at somebody and she's all pissed off, ","then drops the phone on the ground and breaks it, and the guy's mad and he's approaching her saying you know you need to give me back money for the phone and then ","the guy she was screaming on the phone comes.","And he's been sitting there in the car watching them the whole time, like blasting classical music really loud and it seems weird.","And then, and then he's like who's this guy, how do you know him?","And then, and then he's some kind of famous person, he's like do you know who I am?","And the guy realizes who he was, turned out he was some famous magician from some casino and that woman was his assistant and they're having, and he's a really bad person and they're having some kind of problems.","And then, ","and then it turns out the guy is some kind of evil demon or something and he's got like demonic powers and he starts hypnotizing the guy.","It makes his eyes roll back in his head, then he passes out.","He then turns into a dog.","And then we realize at the end that he's turned other people into dogs too, because he's not only a magician, he's got some demonic powers or something.","And then there were a couple animated ones that I remember.","That one, my favorite one was the one with the, the second one, there was a woman sitting in an apartment, it's animated, it's digitally animated.","And she puts a record on the record player and then it skips, and she gets all annoyed, and she fixes it, and then she notices whenever she does something to the record player, it sends her to a different place, a different part of her life.","She puts it on a different song and then like all of a sudden she's in a different apartment, ","and then she's pregnant, and she notices like the more, the more she fools around with the record, and adjust it, it just makes her like more and more pregnant, and she makes it go backwards to make herself less pregnant, ","and then she makes herself more pregnant by fooling around with it even more, then all of a sudden she's holding a baby.","You know, then she fools around with the record player some more.","It makes her get old, then makes her get younger again, then makes her you know switches her to a different apartment, and then a wheelchair, she broke her leg and then she can't do anything with the record player again,  ","and then she just keeps fiddling with the record player and adjusting it, and then she keeps doing that, it keeps taking her through more stages of life until at the end she's dead and she's cremated in an urn.","And then there was another really weird animated one, which is like basically just a bunch of different colored stick figures.","And this real matter-of-fact narrator, he's like ","","And there's this girl at the office that he likes and he wants to be with her, and then he didn't get the promotion and he's all pissed off and then some other guy is going to be with the girl, and he got the promotion.","So the narrator's like ","And then he can't take his body in the elevator because he's going to get blood all over the place.","So he takes him up the stairs, and then he runs into this other person who's going up the stairs, and then,  ","I think he has to kill that person too, and then, and then he realizes what he's done and he's got to jump out the window and kill himself ","and this like matter-of-fact narrator just like saying all this stuff that's happening and it's really, that was one of the weirder ones, it was just stick figures.","And then the other animated one was about a rock that starts out as a big mountain.","It almost reminded me of something that could have been on a show like Sesame Street or something.","It starts out like a couple hundred years ago as a big mountain and then like over all the years, you know you see its lifespan.","People keep doing stuff to it; first, they took it down, they made it into a, they ground it down and made it into a gristmill ","and after that, it got ground down more, and then it ended up getting made into a cannon ball for this, to be used in the Civil War.","And they shot it out of a cannon and then it ended up in the ocean.","And then it washed up on the beach and it became a fossil, and then it ended up in New York probably, what looked like in the 30's.","They put it in a museum, and then it ended up leaving the museum, and then it was on the street, and then it got ran over by a street sweeper.","And it became sand, and then they used the sand to make a lens for a telescope, which got blasted up into space.","And then it started its life over again on a new planet.","It became another mountain again.","It's pretty crazy.","And then there was another movie, about a bunch of robots.","It kind of reminded me of another movie, AI.","There was like this couple sitting down eating dinner together, and the woman's like all annoyed at her boyfriend, because I don't know whatever she's just annoyed with him.","And then it turns out he's actually a robot because she could see a switch on the back of his neck and then she called the company that she got him from, to trade him in because she didn't like him, ","and then she picked out a new robot that she liked better, and then they delivered the new one.","And the new one was you know, taking more of an interest in her, you know asking her how her day was, you know, like she thought she was happier with him, but then it turns out he doesn't really like her either.","He's getting annoyed with her, so and then you realize that she's a robot too, and he just turns her off and goes and does his own thing.","And the first movie that I saw was hmm, To catch a thief, I think.","And it starts out with these three guys on that old game show, to tell the truth, and they have to guess which one is the real guy.","I don't remember his name, but he was this guy that supposedly posed as a pediatrician and airline pilot at the same time, for a couple of years before he finally got caught.","And then they showed the flashback to the scene where he got caught in France.","He was in jail, and he was really sick when he was in jail, and he managed to run away anyway.","And you know, you couldn't really tell if he was actually sick or if he was just faking it pretending but I think he actually was, and they managed to catch him and that was pretty much it for that one.","And then another movie, another movie was about, this was this little short about this guy that's walking down the street while he's drinking a little carton of milk.","And he sees this girl that he likes across the street and he's kind of flirting with her, and they're kind of like dancing back and forth and you know just like flirting with each other across the street, and then he's not paying attention to where he's going.","And he ends up getting hit by a car, and then his shoes fly off and they end up on the ground, and it's basically explained, like how did these shoes get on the ground.","That's basically that one.","Hmm another one, another movie that I've seen.","Oh yeah one of them I think, but it might have been a James Bond movie, but I don't know, is the guy that was in some kind of village somewhere in Europe.","I don't know, he had a British accent, and he realizes he's in some weird village, somewhere in Europe and he has no idea where he's at or how he got there, and he's trying to find out where he is.","Nobody wants to tell him.","He's at a restaurant and he's like can you give me directions, how to get out of here, and the waitress at the restaurant doesn't want to tell him.","And then he goes and tries to make a call from the phone box.","He doesn't know the number so the operator doesn't want to help him and then he uses some kind of weird information thing to get a taxi, and the taxi comes, and she's like I can only take you like local in town.","So he goes as far as he can and then he ends up at a store, he tries to get a map, and they won't give him a map that shows him like anything outside of the village and where they are.","He just basically can't figure out where he is.","What's another one.","Trying to think of another that I saw.","Trying to think of another one.","I can't remember the rest of them for some reason.","I don't know why.","I think I saw the catch a thief one, and then there was the animated one, ","and then there was the one about the rock, and then there was the one about shoes flying up in the air, and then there was the magician, and then there was the robot one.","What other ones were there.","Oh yeah the Black Hole one.","Yeah there's one called the black hole.","It's this guy, he's in an office, for whatever reason, he printed out a big black circle on a piece of paper that just happened to come out of the copy machine for some odd reason.","It didn't show why.","And then he realizes that he could, it's actually a gateway to another dimension.","He could stick his hand inside the black hole and then he realizes that when he puts it up against something, that he could put his hand through whatever he puts the paper up against.","So he realizes that he could use it to steal candy out of the vending machine, and then he realizes that he could use it to steal money out of the vault in his boss' office.","So he went and did that and then he got greedy and then he ended up like going all the way inside the black hole, and he got stuck inside the vault because the piece of paper fell off of it.","So basically all of the money was taken out of the vault, and he was trapped inside.","And that was pretty much it for that short film.","And then there was another one, called Post it love or something.","There's these these two people that work in this office, that kind of have crush on each other, they're kind of in love with each other, ","and then they keep making pictures for the other one with post-it notes, and the pictures keep getting more and more detailed until ","at the end the guy finally makes a giant like mural of the two of them together, made entirely out of post-it notes on the wall in the back.","And that's that one.","And uh now let's see which other ones.","I think I described most of them.","Hmm I know I'm forgetting a couple of them.","I don't remember.","As much as I can remember right this second.","Let's see, I did the one about the post-it notes, the one about the magician, the one that I think was a James Bond movie.","Let's see what other; it's like two or three more that I think I don't remember right this second.","I think that's as much as I can remember."],"duration":{"_EnumKey_":[5,6,9,12,3,11,4,8,7,13,2,15,16,10,14],"_EnumValue_":{"_ArraySize_":104,"_ArrayType_":"uint8","_ArrayZipType_":"zlib","_ArrayZipSize_":104,"_ArrayZipData_":"eJwVyEkSAzEIA8ACJFbb/P+3kxz60qIGikdW9WQMwo94xbmp1aKa/meSaRKUeK37DCsJnOZdMOWC\njODUDokpeGtUWVJ/QTx+iuQCuQ==\n"}}}}},

first movie was Catch Me If You Can, and it started out where Frank Abagnale Jr. was on the TV show To Tell The Truth with two other people, and the point of the show was to find out who was the real Frank, ","and a woman on the panel asked him, who was the person that caught him, and he said, ","And then it changed to a scene where Carl was talking to the French police, because he was there from the FBI to get Frank for his extradition, and when he was taken into the room to see Frank, to read him his rights, Frank was really sick.","He might’ve been pretending to be sicker than he was, and so Carl told the French police to get a doctor, ","and they took, the police and Carl took Frank into a hospital room, but the French police said there wasn’t going to be a doctor until the next day if Carl wanted to take Frank back to America the next day.","And while Carl and the police were arguing, Frank escaped through the door, but since he was sick, he was only able to crawl on the floor, and all the other prisoners were cheering, but eventually the French police and Carl caught up to him, and he surrendered.","The second movie was a woman who had a pizza, ","and she had brought a new record called A Single Life in, and she put the record on the turntable, but it was skipping, and every time it skipped, the pizza was already eaten, ","so then she realized that she could use the record to change time, and she jumped forward.","She was married.","Then she was pregnant, and then she was turning it, and then she turned it forward more, and she had the baby, but that baby was crying, so she jumped back, but then she was a little kid, so she wanted to jump forward again.","She jumped forward, and she was an old woman with a broken leg in a wheelchair, and she wanted to change it, but every time she wanted to wheel forward in her wheelchair, the record would skip and send her back, ","so then she fell over on her back, and the record skipped forward, and she was really old, and she had a walker.","Then she realized the record was about to end, so she tried to rush forward to stop it, but then she was dead, and she was ashes in a vase.","The third movie.","The fifth movie was about Keith Reynolds, ","and Keith was a little blue guy with a purple hat, and he pulled up in his blue car to his office building where he worked, and he expected to get a promotion, which he was really excited about, because he wanted to impress this woman.","I can't remember her name, but she was pink, and every day Keith made a coffee for the pink woman, but she didn't really like him, so she threw it out the window, and it fell onto this orange guy, who was a window cleaner, who had a ladder, and then he fell, ","and then the, a different guy downstairs saw the guy fall.","The guy in HR saw the guy fall.","Then later at the same time, a different guy, maybe his name was Carl, ","no, a different guy,  well a different guy was getting the promotion that Keith wanted to get, or that Keith thought he was gonna get,","so the other guy went downstairs to tell the pink girl about it, and they started kissing, and while Keith was upstairs finding out that he didn't get the promotion, so he was sad.","And then when he saw, and then he went downstairs to make another coffee for the pink woman, he saw her kissing the guy who got his promotion.","Then when the guy who got it got on the elevator, Keith told him to go screw himself, and then the guy punched him in the face, so then Keith beat him up, and then he accidentally killed him.","Then Keith was going to take the body to the stairs, ","but the maybe orange also woman wanted to go up to the seventh floor to use the bathroom, and she was gonna take the stairs, because it was her New Year’s resolution, ","and she was going up the stairs, and she saw Keith coming down the stairs with the body, and she fainted, and since she was on the stairs when she fainted, she also died.","Then, so then, that was on the sixth floor, so then Keith saw the ladder on the sixth floor, and he decided to take the ladder, the body down the ladder,","but then while he was climbing down the ladder, he had a moment of realization, and then the movie ended when he was just standing on the ladder, and the HR guy downstairs saw Keith standing on the ladder, floating kind of balanced in the middle of the place.","So the third movie was the Boyfriend.","It was about a woman, and at first it seemed like she was having anniversary dinner with her husband, her husband, but she was angry with him, because he didn't wanna relax and have a drink with her on their anniversary, because he said he had, he was on call.","But then she was angry, because he was just a computer analyst, and he, so he didn't really need to be totally uptight about having a drink, ","and then she insulted him and said they would have mechanical sex, which turned out to be revealing, because then he was a robot.","She turned him off.","Oh, after he lit a cigarette, which made her mad, she turned him off, ","and then she went to her computer to order a new replacement boyfriend, husband,","and she wanted a rock climber masseuse with more ambition, because the 100 series didn't have enough ambition, and he was 100 series, but she was getting like 300 series rock climber masseuse, ","and then, so the two women came, and  the women looked really similar for some reason.","They came and they delivered the new husband, and then she turned him on and like put the ring and stuff.","Before they took away her old husband, she gave him a kiss, and then she took the ring off and put it on her new husband and turned him on, ","and then she asked him if he wanted a drink, but he said no, because he had a big rock climb the next day.","And then earlier when she was eating dinner with her original husband, she had said something about asparagus being an aphrodisiac, and then the new husband said the same thing about the asparagus, and then he said it was tender, something the old husband had said.","And then the new husband went to give her a massage on her shoulders and asked her about her day, and she was telling him about how she bought a new husband, ","but then while she was telling him that, he turned her off, and it turned out she was also a robot, and then he went to smoke a cigarette and watch TV.","The fourth movie was the Shoe, and there was a guy, and he was just kind of relaxing and leaning against his car, and then this old guy, not old guy, this guy came, and he was like, ","And then, so the guy was walking down the sidewalk, and then he noticed this girl across the street from him, walking down the sidewalk in the same direction, and she was doing all the same stuff as him,","so then they were like walking down the sidewalk goofing around, and making goofy faces.","So then the girl realized that he was about to walk to the edge of the sidewalk and walk into the street where a car was coming, so she was putting her arms up to tell him to stop, but he thought that they were still playing the game.","And then he walked out in front of the car and got hit by the car, and then his shoes came off, and they flew all the way down to, ","at the beginning when they first showed the title of the movie, like where, where they, how they got there, and it showed a pair of shoes, ","and then you find out those were his shoes, and how they got there was that he got hit by a car, because he was goofing around and not paying attention.","The sixth movie was The Rock, and that was about this big boulder with a nose and arms and legs, and you could see him sitting from, starting from when there were dinosaurs and like ice age and stuff and the wind’s eroding him away and things like that.","Until eventually, and he was kind of sleeping peacefully, until one day there were some people with axes next to him, and they disturbed his sleep,","so he walked over to this barn, and he wanted to, no, he walked over to a hill, and next to the hill was a little puff of dirt, and he used it as a pillow.","So he laid down to go back to sleep, but then some guys came and they tugged him away, and they shaped him into like a little circle they used in the mill for making flour, but then, and he was doing that for a while.","And then a bunch of time passed, like in the window you see time passing,  ","and then, but then some soldiers came, and they took him and turned him into a cannonball, and they used him in what was looking like the American Revolution or something, ","and then the cannonball, as a cannonball he kind of broke into little pieces, and he fell down into the bottom of the ocean, and then he walks up on shore, ","and he was turned into, he was smaller, he kept kind of rolling around.","He tried to get some sleep on the street by going underneath a flyer, but then he was rolled over by a steamroller, ","so he turned into a really tiny pebble, and eventually he turned into a piece of sand, and then him and a bunch of other sands were scooped up and they were turned into metal on a satellite.","And the satellite got launched into space, but then it went too far into space, and it crashed into this other planet, but then on that other planet, he like turned, like weather and stuff built him up, and then he was turned back into a really big rock.","And then the next movie was The Prisoner, and this guy, I guess woke up or something, and he was, or, there's a guy, and he's on this island.","And he doesn’t know where he is, so he asks, he asks a couple different, oh he sees a woman and a man near this like cafe, and he asked them where they, where he is, and they don’t really explain.","It’s just like the town, and so he kind of looks around, and he's trying to figure out where he is, but he sees a map, and the map is next to this kind of phone directory, ","and he presses the button for a taxi, and he asks the taxi to take him to the next town, but the taxi says it’s local only, so she just takes him as far as he can go, which ends up being outside of this grocery kind of general store,","and she asks him for two credit units, but he doesn’t have any, so she says he can pay her later, and she says, “Be seeing you,” which ends up being a thing that seems to be a thing that everybody says.","And so the guy goes into the store, and the grocer or clerk is speaking in a weird language to the woman who he's ringing up, and she gets pineapple.","Then, so it’s the man’s turn, and he goes, and he asks the grocer for a map, ","and the map, the man, the grocer gives the man a black and white map, and on the map it’s just the town where they, the village, it’s surrounded by mountains, I guess some mountains, maybe, and it’s surrounded by mountains.","And then the man asks for a larger map, and the grocer gives him a color map, and he says it’s…","and on this map you can see also the ocean and the mountains, but it’s only as big as they get, so the man says, “That’s not what I meant,” to the grocer, who says, “We only have local maps, sorry.”","And then the man just kind of leaves, so he says, “Be seeing you,” like the woman did earlier, and he makes a kind of like “okay” symbol with his hand, like an okay combined with a six.","Then..","the man goes outside, and I think it ends.","The next movie was …","Black Hole, and a guy in an office is making photocopies.","The copier prints out, or scanning, the copier prints out a piece of paper with a big black circle on it,","and the guy is drinking a cup of water or whatever, and he puts the cup down on the table, on top of the paper, but it goes inside the hole, and then he reaches his hand into the hole and takes the cup out.","So then he starts testing it on other stuff, and he holds the paper up and he reaches his hand through it,","and he puts the paper onto the front of a vending machine, and he reaches through, and he gets the free chocolate bar, ","so then he decides to put it on the front of a safe, and he reaches through, and he gets money, then he gets more and more money, and he gets really excited.","So he tapes the paper to the front of the safe, and he like reaches in to get the last bits of money from the back, but he accidentally goes all the way in, ","and then the paper falls off the front of the safe, so he's stuck inside the safe.","And then the next movie was Post-It Love, and there are two people making, a girl and a guy, and they're making photocopies next to each other, or they're separated by a wall, and then they see each other, and I guess they fall in love.","So the, ","one day the guy opens up this blue folder, and it has a smiley face made of post-its in it, which it turns out was sent by the girl, and then the girl sees something made of post-its, but I can’t remember what it was. I missed it.","and then the guy is in the bathroom, and on the door there's like a thought bubble with a heart in it,","and then the girl goes into the office supply closet to get more post-its, and then there's, when she pulls on the light switch, there's lined up with her hand a really big flower with yellow, a big yellow flower.","Then she gets more post-its, and she’s about to make another post-it thing for the guy, and she sees he made this huge mural of post-its with their faces in a heart, or their faces with little hearts, and they're both in it, ","and also when she comes out of the closet there's a little sign that says, “Please use stationary for work purposes only,” which is I guess they're not allowed to pull those out.","The post-its, the rock, the prisoner, the black hole, ","and then the last movie was the Bus Stop, and there was a guy waiting at a bus stop, and it was really hot, and he was listening to music from his phone, no he was listening to music with white headphones, and he had ice cream in a plastic bag.","And then a woman pulls up in a car, like caddy corner from him, ","and there’s a phone, a phone, a payphone, and she goes to use it, but she leaves her car door open, and her car is like moving down the street, but she doesn’t even notice or do anything.","Well she notices, she looks at it, she doesn’t do anything about it, and then she can't use the payphone for some reason, like she doesn’t have any money or something, so she asks the guy to borrow his phone, and she's like, “I’m not gonna steal it.”","But then as she's using it, she like goes across the street, and then she's asking some guy on the phone, “Where is she?” and then she's like, “I'm gonna call the police,”","and then she gets really mad, and she throws the guy’s phone on the ground and breaks it.","So the guy’s like, “Can I have sixty dollars for my phone?” but she doesn’t really listen to him.","She just ignores him, and then she says, “Oh he's here,” and this guy, British guy, pulls up in a car.","And she goes up to him, and she's like, “Where is she? Where is she?” and the guy’s just like, “Calm down,” or whatever.","And then the..","other guy, who had the ice cream, is, comes up, and he's just kind of like, ‘cause he wants his money, and the, the guy, the guy who pulled up who’s a magician asks the woman, “Who is that guy?” and then she says, “He's my friend.”","But then, and then the guy’s coming up, the magician’s coming up to the guy, ","so the other guy’s kind of scared, but he's like, “Oh we’re not friends. I just lent her my phone, and I just want sixty dollars to replace my phone,” but the magician doesn’t really do anything.","And then the woman, she has a paper bag, and all of a sudden, she pulls a gun out of it.","And then, oh, before that, the guy, the ice cream guy, no before that, ","when the guy, when the guy explains, the ice cream guy explains that he's not her friend, the man asks the woman, the magician asks the woman, “Did, did you tell him who I was?” and she's like, “Nobody cares.”","But then the ice cream guy realizes that that guy, the magician is a magician from some casino, and the woman is his assistant, ","so anyway the woman pulls out the gun later, and then the magician gets a gun through magic, I guess, through slight of hand, ","and they hold up the guns at each other, and the other guy is just standing there and doesn’t know what to do.","And then I can't remember what happens, but ","for some reason the woman goes over to the trunk of the car, ","oh she opens it and seems like kind of horrified about what she saw, which I think is supposed to be the girl who she was looking for, who it turns out the magician turned into a dog, I think by accident.","And then the woman, uh","and then the magician is showing the ice cream guy this little coffin that has like a maybe, looks like a dead frog or a frog skeleton or a mouse or something gross in it and the background was a cross, ","and he tries to recite this spell, I think to make him go to sleep, to make the ice cream guy go to sleep, but instead turns him into a dog.","And while the magician’s looking at this piece of paper with the spell on it to try to figure out what he did wrong, the woman shoots him, and then he shoots her.","And the other girl, the girl who the woman might’ve been looking for, who was turned into a dog, comes up to the guy who’s a dog, also dog,","and the guy who turned into, the ice cream guy, dropped his ice cream, which was all melted, and then he was licking it like a dog on the street, and the girl came up, and they were sniffing the ice cream and both sniffing each other I guess and barking, ","and then they, they walk away, or they walk like dogs down the street.","I'm done."],"duration":{"_EnumKey_":[20,8,25,11,19,21,16,2,17,15,4,10,18,6,12,9,14,13,27,3,7,23,24,5],"_EnumValue_":{"_ArraySize_":123,"_ArrayType_":"uint8","_ArrayZipType_":"zlib","_ArrayZipSize_":123,"_ArrayZipData_":"eJwFwQsWAiEIAMAXgqzIT5Lq/idt5gUDaSLDswRwq5HvSEODU/T2UXUbuLOSUGclY8RnKXlVHPsK\nsbEAY8ndt/N0h7b9RG1gcovEBoWeHqpW6LrZF0aJPn9EMwWM\n"}}}}},

so, it begins with a cartoon and some singing and some animals and people I think?","And they're singing to go to the lobby to get some snacks I believe.","And they sing about getting popcorn, and getting candy and chocolate.","Um and there's images of the popcorn, and images of them eating candy and chocolate.","Um and so yeah so they sing about that and then it ends with the words, let's all go to the lobby to get ourselves a snack I believe is what it says?","And then Catch Me If You Can is the first story.","And it begins with a game show and we're introduced to three men.","Well the game show is called ","And they're each named Frank William Abagnale.","And he's a con man and he basically did a variety of cons before the age of 19.","He was like an attorney general, he worked in a hospital as a surgeon, and he did something else.","So anyways they go and they sit at a table, or like a little stand with the numbers 1, 2, and 3.","And then the first game show member asks number 1 why they decided to be a con artist with all their talent, and the first person responds, that it was really about dollars and cents and that they wanted to make money and this is how they saw that they could make money.","And then she asked the second person, who the person was, the second person was Leonardo di Caprio, who the person was that caught Frank eventually and he says that it was the, I don't know if he was the attorney general or he works for the US attorney, Carl Haverford or something like that?","Um and then it turns into a scene in France, in Marseilles, um on Christmas Eve and I think it was like in 1969, or something?","And the, Tom Hanks is trying to convince the French police officers to let him see Frank in this prison.","And so they let him see Frank and it's raining outside and then they come inside and they let him see Frank.","Um but he has to sit outside his prison cell and like only talk to him through a little slit.","And he's instructed not to hand him anything.","Um and then the police officer tells a guard in French to stay and watch.","Um and um so Tom Hanks opens his umbrella, or Carl, the detective or attorney general person, um and he opens his umbrella because I guess the ceiling is leaking and he's trying to talk to Frank.","And he's trying to read him um rules about extradition.","And Frank in his cell was trying to tell Carl to help him and he says he looks really sick, and um Hank, Tom Hanks tells Frank that he's not gonna trick him.","But eventually Frank falls over, and then Tom Hanks yells and calls for a doctor.","And so then they, the police officers get Frank out of his cell and take him to some, sort of like a hospital ward room.","And they lay him down.","And then the officers all go over to a sink to wash their hands for fear of lice and uh Tom Hanks asks when the doctor's gonna get there and the chief police officer I guess tells him that the doctor won't be here until the next day.","And Tom Hanks objects to this.","And then as he's objecting, the chief police officer turns, and then there's a door that has been left open, and then he goes to check the bed that they put Frank in that was surrounded by curtains, and he splits the curtains apart and Frank is gone.","And so he instructs his officers to go after him, um and then the scene turns to basically like a general prison population and they're all really excitable and excited because Frank is sort of running and trying to get away.","But because he's really sick he doesn't make it really far.","And he sort of stumbles on the floor and starts crawling.","And then the police officers and Tom Hanks are walking towards him.","And eventually the police officer puts a gun to Frank's head and Frank stops.","And then he turns around and falls on his back.","And then he says to Tom Hanks, or Carl, I think his name is, um, all right, let's go home.","And then there's some talking and then the scene ends.","Um the next scene is called The Boyfriend and, no the Record and this is a cartoon and there is a woman who was about to eat some pizza, a box of pizza and then her doorbell rings and then outside the doorbell there's an envelope and she picks it up and she opens it.","And it's a record called ","And she puts the record on and it starts playing and as it starts playing she finds, she's holding a slice of pizza and when she's about to put it in her mouth she finds that it's like already eaten.","And then she realizes it has to do with the record.","And so when she spins the record one way, the pizza becomes whole again and when she spins it another way, it sort of shortens.","And so then she spins it all the way and all the pizza is gone.","And then she decides to take the sort of spinning thing off the record player and put it back on.","And then she's taken to a new scene um which I guess is a new time in her life.","And in the scene she's pregnant.","Um she has a little baby bump.","And she sort of plays with the record again, making her baby bump bigger and smaller.","And then she spins it all the way and then her baby is born.","Um and the baby's kind of crying.","Um and then she uh messes with the record player again.","And this time, she is a little girl with a doll and then she messes with the record player again and this time she is like an old lady in wheelchair, an older woman in a wheelchair with like a foot in a cast and she doesn't I guess like this scene.","And she tries to change it again, but each time she tries to change it, I know she like knocks the record player, like the bench over with, or the table over, with her foot in the cast.","And so it takes her multiple attempts to change the record player.","And then the next scene she's a really old elderly woman and she has to use a walker.","Um and so she uses the walker to change the scene again and um this time, she becomes an urn, and essentially the scene kind of ends there.","And then the next scene is the Boyfriend.","And the words ","And then it turns to a scene where a woman and presumably her boyfriend are sitting across the table, eating dinner and apparently it's their valentine, sorry anniversary.","Um and she is sort of trying to make light conversation with him and she seems somewhat dissatisfied.","So he's sort of eating very meticulously and not really paying attention to her.","She gets up and tries to pour him some wine and he declines, and she's sort of frustrated by that and then he says that the asparagus is really tender and she mentions that it's an aphrodisiac, um that people say that it's an aphrodisiac, or they say.","And he asks, you know, who says that?","And she says, just people.","And um so then he decides to light a cigarette and she gets really upset with him and tells him not to light a cigarette in her house and she takes away his cigarette and then um puts it in the ash tray.","And then he just lights another one.","And she gets really frustrated with him and says that basically this is not how she planned on spending her anniversary, uh getting smoke in her apartment and having stilted conversation, and mechanical sex.","And she feels really bad for saying that last part, so she goes over to him and like sits in his lap and hugs him and sort of starts rubbing his neck.","And then when she's doing that, and they're sort of like ominous music playing, um, and when she does that also, I don't know if this matters, but to describe in detail, they're both in white people, and she has short brown hair, and he has short brown hair as well.","Um and then when she's hugging him she turns off a switch behind his neck, and then she goes over to her computer, and is on a website I think it's called Prometheus, and I guess there's a bunch of robot men. 11:56 Um and so she finds the man that she wants, the new man she wants, who is like a masseuse, a masseur, who is giving a massage, and who has longer hair, and a beard.","And so she calls up I guess the uh robotics company and tells them she hasn't been satisfied with her product, the 100 series.","And they ask her what's wrong, and she says he lacks ambition and something else and adventure.","And they say that's a typical problem with the 100 series and ask her if she would like to upgrade and she says yes.","And they ask her if she has an idea of like what she'd like to upgrade to and she says, yes.","She started to list a couple options at first, and then eventually gets to the one that she actually wants, but she said she'd like him to have shorter hair and less of a beard, like more of a five o'clock shadow and um but yeah, she basically describes a guy giving the massage who likes rock-climbing.","So um the robotics people come to her apartment and deliver, presumably apartment, um, and deliver the new robot she ordered.","And they, there's two um identical I think blonde women who come to deliver the new robot and then they take away the old robot.","But before, as they're like leaving on the elevator, uh the woman gets on the elevator and gives the old robot a kiss and takes off the ring off his ring finger and then she goes back to the apartment and puts the ring on her new robot boyfriend.","Um and so then she turns him on, and they're sitting at the dinner table again.","She offers him some wine, and he says that he can't have any because he has a climb the next day.","And she seems a little distraught, disappointed by that but then he mentions that the asparagus is very well-tended to or something and then he says that people mention that it's an aphrodisiac, and she says, who says that, and he says, just people.","And then she, he stands up and walks over to her, and starts giving her a massage and asks her how her day was, and she recounts her day back to him.","She says how she goes into town, went into town to get stuff for her meal and then she had a light lunch with somebody and I guess ran some other errands.","And then as he's massaging her, he turns off her, the switch behind the back of her neck, and then he goes and sits on the couch and turns on the TV and then lights a cigarette and that's is the end.","And then, so there's the record, the boyfriend, um, there's um another scene.","Oh the shoe.","Um so the scene begins with the words ","And then it opens into a street and a man is leaning against a car wearing the shoes that were pictured and um he's looking across the street at a woman in a red skirt and then the person who owns the car that he's leaning against comes out.","And he sort of uh tells the guy leaning against his car to you know go away.","So the guy gets off the street and he gets onto the sidewalk.","And he stumbles as he's walking, and then the woman across the street that he was looking at um imitates him and so he realizes that she's imitating him and sort of, they start kinda going back and forth and so he makes the motions and she imitates him.","And then eventually she makes the motions and he imitates her.","And then they keep doing this sort of for a block, and then they get to an intersection and because he's really focused on imitating her, he doesn't realize that a car is coming and she tries to warn him, but he doesn't realize and thinks that they're still sort of playing the game.","So he's just going, and then, he, the car that's coming crashes into him, and he is sort of catapulted into the air, and the car is also catapulted into the air, and it sort of flips in the air and lands and it's sort of all cracked and destroyed.","And he, his shoe comes off when he is hit by the car and it ends up right next to the sidewalk, um, and then there's the camera shows another similar shoe, black shoe, and I think that's how the first few videos end.","The second set of videos are like, were very confusing to me.","Oh and then there's the, so there's Keith Reynolds.","This is like sort of a stick figure cartoon and he shows up in a car and the words ","So Keith Reynolds parks his car in front of a building and he gets out, then he goes back to his car and grabs a blue hat, and he goes into the building, and we're told that Keith is expecting a promotion, 'cause he's the most senior junior worker and he goes up to the fifth floor where a girl he likes, I think her name is Sarah, is working.","And he hands her a cup, he makes her coffee every day even though she doesn't want it and he's hoping that this promotion will get her to like him.","So he hands her the coffee, which she throws out the window, and the coffee ends up landing on I guess a window cleaner stick figure who ends up falling down the building and then Bill in HR sees someone tumbling down the side of the building and calls for an ambulance, and then meanwhile Keith goes, while Keith is getting up to the 7th floor where he'll, where he expects to receive a promotion, Patrick is in an office with someone and he shakes somebody's hand, and leaves the office and then goes down to where Sarah is to tell her the good news. 19:11 And then meanwhile Keith goes up to the floor expecting a promotion and a strong handshake, but instead, he gets, the handshake is, turns out to be weak and he doesn't get the promotion.","Um so he decides he's gonna go down and see if Sarah will still like him, but when he gets down there, he sees that Patrick and Sarah are actually kissing, and while he was upstairs, Patrick and Sarah were like hugging and Patrick had told Sarah the good news.","Um so he gets down and he sees that them kissing, and Keith is really upset.","Then Patrick asked him to hold the elevator, which he does, um and then it seems, well not by choice, because while they were kissing, it seems like the elevator is taking a really long time to close, um, and then Patrick gets onto the elevator, and Keith is so mad, that um, something happens, that leads Keith to punch Patrick in the face, and then Keith keeps punching Patrick in the face, and eventually he hits him with his briefcase and he ends up killing Patrick.","And so he panics, and he has to get um Keith's body, or hide Keith's body, so he gets, without anybody seeing him.","So he gets off the elevator, Keith gets off the elevator with Patrick's body, and then Ruth I guess her name is, um is going up to the 7th floor because that's where her favorite bathroom is.","And she takes the stairs instead of the elevator, because she like had resolved to do so, and when she takes the stairs, she sees Keith with Patrick's body, and she faints and tumbles down the stairs, and then Keith has to, Keith keeps going.","Um and he runs into Sarah who also faints, and I'm not quite sure how the story ends.","Um and then, uh sort of the stories after this are very confusing and I don't really remember which, where which story ended.","But there was the post-card love story, um, where, which starts up with a scene of two people by a printer, a photocopier, a girl and a guy, and they're both photocopying things, and they're, there's like a divider between them.","And um so they both go back to their desk, and the guy sees, has a little note on his desk, and I think it's from the girl, I don't remember exact details.","But eventually he decides to make an entire mural out of post cards with both their faces and I think they're like kissing or something and it's this huge mural, and she walks in, and she sees the mural, and he stops and looks at her, and she's like incredibly you know happy about the mural, so that's that.","Um there's a really confusing story where uh there's someone who's like sort of teaching magic, and I don't really recall much about this story but eventually two people get shot, shoot at each other and then this guy recites this spell that turns this other guy into a dog.","And the guy who recited the spell shoots at a woman, who I guess shot at him back, and so the woman and him are both laying on the floor dead.","And then the guy who turned into a dog starts crawling on his hands and barking alongside a road and then he runs into another woman who is also under the spell, and pretending to be a dog.","And then they sort of play around with each other and bark at each other, and then they keep crawling for some time.","Yeah that's pretty much most of what I can recall.","I'm done."],"duration":{"_EnumKey_":["N/A"],"_EnumValue_":{"_ArraySize_":118,"_ArrayType_":"uint8","_ArrayZipType_":"zlib","_ArrayZipSize_":118,"_ArrayZipData_":"eJxjZBwIAAAb4wB3\n"}}}}},

so one of the movies was called the Shoe.","The shoe started with a sneaker um that I think was Velcro, blue, uhh lying in the gutter and it was lying sideways.","It turned right side up and started tapping.","And there was a little subtitle before this that said how they get there.","Um and this guy is walking down the street and he looks at a girl across the street from him and he notices that she’s mimicking him.","He like reaches up and touches something, and she does the same and then uh, or it first, first he trips, and she trips, mimicking him, and then reaches up and touches something and she does the same.","Then they start doing all these, like bending down gestures with their hands um being silly, copying each other.","And then she sees that he’s gonna walk into the street continuing to mimic her.","And she starts to warn him with her hands, not saying anything, just like making scary hand gestures.","And he just keeps mimicking them, and then walks right in front of this car, which is like an old brown sedan.","And he smashes the windshield and um it gets launched into the air and lands really far away after like a long slow motion shot of the car in the air.","And then he uh, the guy gets launched and his shoe flies into the air, this is the guy who was being mimicked.","And then his shoe lands in the gutter and the shoe like is in the position that the shoe was in in the beginning of the movie.","And the camera pans and you see an older black shoe also in the gutter.","So now you know how shoes get in the gutter.","Um there was one called the Record where this cartoon girl who looks like a broomstick with orange hair uh gets a record in the mail and she puts the record on and notices that her pizza is disappearing.","And then she stops the record and rewinds it, and the pizza comes back and she plays with that.","Um and then she like speeds it up and skips to a different part of the record entirely and then finds that she’s in completely new surroundings in a, um.","Before she was like in a dorm, um, on like a futon kind of thing, and now she’s in a pretty nice house with this like fancy yellow chair next to her and she’s well-dressed and she’s pregnant.","And she moves the record back and forth and sees the size of her belly changing and then gets to having a baby.","And then she looks a little miffed because she doesn’t really want to deal with a baby.","Um she goes back in time and she’s holding a doll; she’s a kid.","And then, she like can’t really reach the record anymore, um so she like tries to reach up and she bumps it and it takes her forward way into the future, and now she’s in a wheelchair.","She has like a broken leg and uh she keeps trying to move the record, but it keeps skipping um.","Finally, she moves the record, like the reason she’s having trouble is because she’s in the wheelchair and she can’t get close enough.","It keeps skipping.","Eventually she moves it and then she’s like even older in that house and she has a walker.","And then um she, let’s see, she moves it.","I can’t remember if she moves it even further forward, but then it skips again.","Oh she falls over the walker and then the needle jumps and then she’s um in an urn. She’s dead.","Um there was a Catch me if you can clip that started off with a show, game show called To tell the truth, with big like a golden title card opens up and um three guys come out and they all say that their name is Frank William Abignail Junior.","Uhh there’s like a brown haired dude, a short brown-haired dude, then Leonardo di Caprio having like floppy hair, and then a taller guy.","And you’re told that you’re gonna like meet, it’s a game show, the game show host says like that he’s introducing one of them is a con man.","And they all claim to be that con man.","Um and then they’re all like standing there in a line saying that they’re that guy.","Then they go sit down and they start fielding questions from the game show host.","The first guy fields one, uh I forget what it was.","The second guy, which is Leonardo di Caprio, the real guy, uh gets asked how he caught.","And then he starts to have a flashback after saying who caught him, which is Carl something played by Tom Hanks with the, those like hip glasses.","Um so the flashback goes to Tom Hanks standing outside a prison in Marseilles in 1969.","And it’s dark and he’s talking to some French people who let him in to see the cell with Leo in it.","And they say you know, they basically say, don’t try to get him out of here, don’t go into the cell, don’t pass him anything through this little slot that we open up for you.","He sits down and he looks in and we see um Leonardo who we know from the game show had done a bunch of things by the time he was 19.","He had like committed 4 million dollars worth of fraudulent transactions in 26 states, 26 countries and all 50 states.","Uh and we see him, he’s got this like nasty long hair and a neck beard and a terrible cough.","And uh um Carl is not really buying it at first, and um Leo keeps coughing and looking miserable.","And Carl is reading him some legal documents, reading them too fast to understand, um.","And then, Leo is really, really selling this I’m sick, I need to get out of here thing, and eventually he collapses.","And uh yeah Tom Hanks throws his chair and stands up and says we need a doctor.","Um and eventually they start dragging Leo who’s continuing to act all sick um, I mean he really is sick, but he’s acting extra sick.","So they’re dragging him to some bed, they throw him in the bed.","Carl is demanding that he get put on a plane.","And the French people like get him in the bed and then just start washing their hands and saying they’re getting rid of all the lice uh and that you know he’s not, they're not, he's gonna get a doctor tomorrow when the doctor comes in.","Um and they’re saying they’re not going to take him to the US.","And Carl says I’ve worked you hard to have you take this away from me now.","But then one of the French people notices that the door is open and throws the curtains to where the bed with uh Abignail Junior was supposed to be and he’s gone.","And he’s dragging himself down the corridor of the prison and he’s looking really, really raggedy and crawling on the ground.","And uh all the prisoners are like slamming on the gate, what’s it fence, and cheering and yelling.","And um Carl and all the French officials walk down the hall and one puts a gun to Leo’s head.","And Leo throws up his arms and lies down on the ground and kind of like smiles in a resigned way.","And Tom Hanks says something like, “Oh, Frank.”","And I think that’s the end of that clip.","What else.","There was the weird creepy robot thing where it was this couple having like a way overly stilted dinner conversation.","They’re at the end of a long dinner table, it's a you know they look like they’re in their late 30s or early 40s maybe.","And um the man is well-dressed and, well they’re both really well-dressed and there’s like a really nice dinner table set up and.","Um, they’re having asparagus and um she says um let’s see.","She asks if he wants, she walks over with wine, first to pour him a glass of wine.","He covers the glass, says you know I can’t have wine when I’m on call.","She goes back to her seat, she says you’re just a computer analyst, you’re not a surgeon, you can drink a little, it’s our anniversary.","He um isn’t happy with that and he puts on, he smokes a cigarette.","And she takes the cigarette from him and she says that you can’t smoke in my house, gets really upset.","She says like oh yeah this is exactly what I wanted, passive smoke on my anniversary, and maybe some stilted conversation and then if I’m really lucky, some mechanical sex.","And um he kind of looks robotic and like it looks like she’s trying her best to hurt his feelings by saying something mean and he’s trying his best to show that he doesn’t feel anything that she says.","He says something about the asparagus being tender.","She says that it’s an aphrodisiac.","He asks, who says that and she says, oh it’s just something people say.","Um that was earlier I guess cuz it’s after the mechanical sex comment that she walks over to him and acts like she feels bad and sits in his lap and leans his head on her shoulder.","And then is like consoling him saying she’s sorry that she said that, and then she finds a little off switch on his neck and turns him off cuz he’s a robot and uh.","Then she takes out her computer, which is an apple macbook pro and looks at a website for a bunch of other of these robot lover things.","Um and she puts on a little earpiece and makes a phone call and orders um this one.","She orders one, well she says that her 100 unit is acting up because it lacks ambition.","And she asks for the 300 unit, well she asks for a rock-climber masseuse and like the one in the photo.","And so then these like two tall blond girls who look very alike knock on her door and deliver a new unit and take the old unit away.","And oh yeah, she says that the new unit shouldn’t have a beard but it could have some 5 o’clock shadow.","And um so they take the old unit away and she’s like oh wait a second and she kisses him.","He’s like in a Annabel Lecter style like, not really.","But he’s in a dolly like leaned up against it.","They take him away.","So then yeah she takes his wedding ring, puts it on her new guy, sits him in a chair, boots him up.","He doesn’t want to drink because he has a big climb tomorrow which is too reminiscent of the old guy.","And then um he walks over to her and starts giving her a massage and she’s so happy.","And then he finds, oh he says the thing about the asparagus.","They say it’s an aphrodisiac, she says who says, he says just something they say.","Then he starts giving her the massage.","She’s so happy.","Then he turns her off switch and goes and sits in the couch and smokes a cigarette, drinks a beer, and watches TV.","Um let’s see.","There’s a nice silver saucer on the table during that one.","So then there was a, the post-it love one where there are two people who um.","I forget how it became clear that they were interested in each other, but she leaves a post it of a smiley face in a closed folder on his desk and he really likes that.","And then they have this escalating exchange of leaving post-it notes around for each other in different patterns which culminates in him.","She like goes to the storage closet to get all the post-it notes, and then walks down the hall, and she sees that he’s already um put up a big giant post-it of their faces.","And there’s a bunch of hearts coming out of it.","I guess some of the intervening ones were like uhh.","Yeah so she does that smiley face, then he does uh um an orange sun which she notices when she raises the blinds.","And then she does a like flower heart or something on the, I think it’s a flower on the bathroom stall which he sees when he’s looking in the mirror.","And then he does uhh something on the wall with the storage closet which is where she gets all the post it notes.","And then she sees him making those faces and she’s smiling and happy because of that.","Uh there was another one about romance which starred stick figures named Keith Reynolds and Patrick Campbell.","Keith Reynolds goes to his office thinking that he’s getting a promotion.","He’s like a tall blue stick figure, gets out of this car, walks into this building, goes up to, I don’t know, I forget if it’s the 4th or the 7th floor.","Um oh yeah, so first he’s imagining going up to the 7th floor to shake hands and sign with a gold pen his promotion.","On the way up to the 7th floor he stops at the 4th floor, where he sees this shapely pink stick figure bending over.","He’s in love with her.","He’s trying to get her to love him and want to marry him by giving her coffee even though she doesn’t want coffee every day.","Um so he gives her some coffee and then he uh.","He goes up the um elevator to the 7th floor.","Meanwhile, the pink lady who he loves, pours the coffee out the window onto somebody’s head, who falls down.","The guy below her sees her falling, checks that it’s a person, and not some thing, it's someone not something.","And then he calls an ambulance.","So meanwhile, Keith Reynolds is going up to the 7th floor where he is um about to see Patrick Campbell come out of the office.","And Patrick Campbell has, is the one who’s actually gotten the promotion.","And Keith Reynolds goes in and the handshake is not as firm as he was hoping and there’s not gold pen.","And he’s very sad.","And uhh I guess maybe it’s worth saying that this one is all narrated and they don’t talk at all, the characters.","And then in the Shoe and the Record and the Post It one, also no one says anything.","It’s just um, there’s no narration and there’s no dialogue.","So anyways, in this one, so he doesn’t get the promotion, he goes down, it turns out Patrick Campbell and the pink girl whose name might be Sarah are a thing.","And they’re kissing.","He’s like telling her about the promotion.","And um Keith is standing in the elevator wishing that the door would close because he had gone down to see how the pink lady was uh.","He’d just gone down to see her kind of to like feel better after not getting the promotion.","And he imagines what he would do if Patrick got in a small space with him.","And then it actually happens cuz Patrick comes to the elevator after the elevator stays open for too long.","And then they go back up to Patrick’s office and on the way out of the elevator, on Patrick’s way out of the elevator, Keith says, presumably, go fuck yourself, um three words he had never said to anyone before.","And uh Patrick comes back to punch him in the face.","And then Keith reciprocates and eventually punches him down to the ground.","There’s like blood spraying around the elevator and then he beats his face in with the briefcase.","And at this time, the woman downstairs who is, forget what her job is, but she’s coming up to use the bathroom cuz her favorite bathroom is on the 7th floor cuz of the soap is better.","And so he starts dragging.","Keith starts dragging dead Patrick down the stairs cuz he thinks that would be better than taking him down the elevator cuz he doesn’t want to run into anyone.","And um so he’s bringing Patrick down the stairs, he runs into the woman who’s on her way up to use the bathroom.","She sees him and the dead body and faints, and falls down the stairs and I guess dies.","There’s blood for sure, there’s a cracking sound.","Um and he, Keith, thinks you know it’s a genuine accident.","Uh and what does he do?","He starts dragging Patrick towards the window, doesn’t know what he’s doing yet, but he starts dragging him towards the window.","And then um the woman who he’s in love with starts coming up because she wants to see Patrick.","She’s bringing files to him but it’s just an excuse to see him.","And then uh she ends up um seeing the dead body and also fainting and Keith thinks, I guess dead bodies have that effect on women.","And then he decides to throw Patrick out the window.","He’s gonna use that ladder that’s left over from the person who fell down because of the hot coffee.","So then he kind of drops Patrick out the window and he’s starting to climb down and then he looks in the building and sees um.","He sees the janitor who he’s never talked to before, and he thinks about um, and this is like, this is I guess not foreshadowed but like thematically related to earlier where he looks into the silver walls of the elevator and sees his own reflection.","Here this time he sees the janitor, and he thinks about how in one second, you know even if you’re fighting for the job et cetera et cetera, um, and your life is going so well, then one second that can all change, as evidenced by Patrick.","And he’s staring at this janitor and he just balances there for a while.","And I think that’s the end of that clip.","Um so then there’s the magician one.","So in the one with the magician, what happens is, this dude in white headphones and a red t-shirt is standing around being sweaty looking kinda dopey waiting for the bus I guess.","And this woman drives up in an SUV, gets out, leaves the door open, and leaves the car in drive.","She’s barefoot and in like a, uh, leggings and a nightgown kind of thing, looking frazzled.","She tries to use a payphone.","The payphone doesn’t work.","She paces around.","She comes up to the dude.","She asks him for, she can use his phone.","It’s like a brick phone, like a blackberry or something.","She uses it to call somebody, and she keeps yelling and saying she’ll involve the police.","And then she gets really distraught and spikes the phone on the ground and it shatters.","And the guy is, miss, uh, this phone is broken.","Can you give me like 60 bucks?","And she’s completely uninterested.","And then a car pulls up, maybe two blocks away under an overpass and she says, that’s him.","And she walks over to that car.","And he’s following her because he wants the money for his phone.","And there’s a lanky uh man who looks like he was well-dressed but has taken his shirt off, he’s wearing like suspenders and stuff and an untied bow tie.","And um she keeps yelling, where is she?","And then she pulls out a gun and points it at him.","Um at the guy who we will eventually find out is the magician.","She says where is she?","And then the guy is like asking the red shirt guy who he is.","He explains about the phone, uh he says, he asks uh if he recognizes him.","The frazzled woman is like you know you’re so paranoid, of course he doesn’t recognize you.","Red shirt guy is eventually like, oh, no, I do recognize you.","You’re that magician.","He even says him by name.","And there’s this kind of like staredown while she’s pointing the gun at the magician.","And he pulls out a little gun in a kind of magic trick sort of way.","And um let’s see, she, it’s like a nice gun, he says something about its fancy origins and used by some other person.","Then there’s a quiet moment and you hear like weird yelling, yelping coming from the trunk of this car that the man was leaned up against.","And she goes and starts screwing around with the trunk and because the orange shirt, red shirt guy knows who the magician is, he pulls out this magic trick, this little tiny um.","It’s a tiny little like coffin shaped thing with a cross on it and he starts reading it, some kind of a verse and it starts to stupefy and hypnotize the red shirt guy while the woman is futzing with the trunk.","And then she finally gets the trunk open and is horrified by what she sees.","And she walks over and she shoots the man who has, well okay, so first, the man has hypnotized this guy.","Orange shirt guy’s ice cream has melted and he's like fallen on the floor and he’s kind of like convulsing, making dog noises.","The magician goes like oh shit and reads, pulls out a piece of paper and reads the verse that he had been reading, and like corrects whatever mistake it was, realizes he read it wrong.","And she comes, the frazzled woman comes over and shoots him and from the ground he shoots her.","And they both are lying there as the guy who um was in the

so I guess I'll start with the last movie.","Um The Bus Stop.","Uh this is a movie that involves Aldini the magician and his assistant and a random guy at the bus stop.","So this lady stops her car all of a sudden and uh tries to use a public phone but it's not working so she borrows this guy who's waiting for a bus with his white headphones and his red t-shirt um.","She asks if the guy could lend her his phone so she could make a call and then she makes the call.","Uh and then she's really upset with her call so she like breaks the phone and this guy just wants like 60 bucks and like he's really chill about it, he doesn't really mind whether the lady doesn't pay her, she seems to not even being paying attention to the guy and the Aldini appears in his car and they get in some sort of like an argument.","She pulls out her gun uhh Aldini also does a magic trick, pulls out his gun and they end up confronting each other and then she shoots a shot in the air just to show how serious she is and then this other guy seeing these two people are really weird, tries to leave, but Aldini tries to like pull a magic trick on him that was supposed to have maybe like uhh switch souls or something with the lady's daughter, but then he ends up turning the guy into this illusion what he thinks he's a dog.","And then this lady since she is pissed after she sees what Aldini did to his, her daughter, she shoots Aldini just before he dies he shoots the lady, so they both die.","And then this guy and the lady's daughter are stuck being dogs and so they attract each other and like walk away barking.","Uh the second movie I'll talk about is The Rock.","This is a movie about this huge rock that was once a mountain, and goes into what I think is hibernating, uh, sleeps, and then has nightmares of like undergoing a lot of bad things, he could undergo as a rock, uh, I remember one scene where the rock is actually pulled out by a donkey and is used in like a well to pump water.","It is also used like in war, like in those cannons that throw stones apparently instead of bombs.","Um we see the rock undergo the large changes, sometimes it's crashed, and like it really started as a huge rock but ends up as a really small rock.","Uh it even goes in outer space.","Uh it's dropped in molten lava.","Um and uh at the end of this, we find out that the rock uh the rock is even in a museum, where this kid bangs on the window and then the rock falls out of the back of like a wolf's mouth and into the trash can and out to the street.","Uh you know some random person kicks it across the street and throws it in someone's window.","Finally he looks like a jealous boyfriend of, well the rocket he is traveling and traveling.","At the end, the huge rock wakes up and notices it was all a bad dream.","Another movie I'll talk about is the intro song, let's go to the lobby.","It's like four cartoon dancing singing, let's go to the lobby where and have ourselves a treat.","There's popcorn, I guess ice cream, and it's all color-y and stuff.","For that I'll talk about the Prisoner.","This is a movie where this guy like just randomly finds himself in the village where he doesn't know where it is and tries to like get a taxi or like make phone calls and no one really responds.","They just say, you can't like get out of the community, like you have to stay locally and he goes into a shop, tries to get maps, but all the maps are not really helpful.","They just show mountains and logs.","Uh he tries to get colored maps but there's not really helpful the same time.","Tries to ask this lady for her phone so she could make calls, but he says they don't have phones, they just use the booth in one of the streets.","And when she tries, when he tries to the use the phone booth, he needs a number.","And apparently he's not a member of the village, so he doesn't know what number, so he's kind of like stuck in this village where he's like a prisoner.","He doesn't know what to do.","Uhh the other movie I'll talk about is uhh Catch me if you can.","This uh young I guess let's say genius criminal Frank, he uh you know imitated pilot, uh a pediatrician and a county attorney general deputy.","And uhh he says he got caught by some other guy, I think he's an American FBI detective.","And then they flash back to the scene in I guess Russia where he's in prison and he's really sick.","This guy comes to read to him, his rights and what the constitution says, and then he passes out, Frank passes out, or pretends to pass out.","He's quickly rushed to the prison hospital where he tries to escape.","But then the crew catch up to him and one of the guards put a gun to his head.","And then Frank like lies down saying like, now I'm ready to go home.","Uhh there's also a weird part of this movie.","There's like a show, where there's 3 Franks apparently and there's this lady asking the 3 Franks why he never chose one career, but just decided to go for 3 and why a man of his abilities would just decide to waste his talents like that and yeah it's all really uh confusing.","Uhh the other show I'll talk about is the Shoe.","Uh this is a guy and lady uh who like notice each other across the streets and like start playing around with each other, doing the same actions, walking, trying to dance around, but then apparently the guy is paying too much attention to the lady on the other side of the street, then the lady on the other side of the street can see a car approaching from the blind side of this other guy and tries to tell the other guy look to the other side, there's a car coming, don't cross the road, but this guy is too, he pays a lot of attention to the lady and doesn't end up seeing the car and gets hit.","He's uh way up and finally I think he dies and his shoes fly all over the place and we flash back to how the movie began, with how we got here, with the shoe.","The other movie I want to talk about is about this guy, I can't really remember the name, but it's kind of like the cartoonified version of this guy who kills another guy in the building where he works where he expected to get a promotion.","I think it's Kevin Hornsby or something.","Uhh and the guy is Peter and Peter's the one who actually got the girl who the main guy wanted to get.","And so, uh, he kills this guy and starts to take him, he kills him in the elevator after they get in a confrontation over the girl, over something they said to each other, and so as he takes the body down the stairs he meets another lady, Vanessa, who'd like to use the bathroom on the 7th floor 'cause it you know had a better soap dispenser system.","And so she passes out and falls down the stairs and also dies.","And then the lady whose boyfriend was killed, sees uh this is the body has, the guy tries to escape the stairs through the outer ladder of the 5th floor, she also passes out.","And then it kind of like ends with uh the main character stuck uh on the stairs as he tries to balance for his life.","Uh the other movie I'll talk about is the Boyfriend.","This is a movie about robotics, robots, such as this girlfriend with this really mechanical boyfriend uh kind of sad with their anniversary, asked if he could have any wine, and he says no uh, apparently he has something important to do tomorrow.","And then the lady is so tired of his boyfriend not showing affection, and then he pours wine on him and tells him you know you could loosen up, and then the guy pulls out a cigarette, tries to smoke, the lady doesn't want the guy smoking, so she, you know, disposes the first cigarette, the guy lights up the second one.","The lady pretends to be affectionate and, by, tries to cuddle and relax the guy, but then you know slowly pushes the switch behind him and turns him off and then orders for a new boyfriend.","And as the new boyfriend arrives, um, the robotics company disposes the first one, and she kisses the first one goodbye.","And then tries to talk to the second one.","The second one seems to be the same character as the first one where we even see what he says, the asparagus are tender, but then there's a little bit of switch in this 'cause now he says, that's what people say, it's an aphrodisiac, and then, you know she's really flattered, and then the guy tries to like a massage uhh, her, and then ends up turning off her switch, so she ends up also being a robot, and then he's watching, uhh, he ends up watching TV, I think sports, 'cause he was all muscular, and I think he was into like rock-climbing and all that athlete stuff.","Yeah.","Uh so the other movie I want to talk about is ooh.","Ahh one minute please, um.","The Record.","So this is a movie where there's this lady who realizes this record can actually control time.","When she spins it back, uh, she spins it back, her pizza goes back into full, when she spins it forward, you know, her pizza gets eaten and eaten away.","She realizes that she can actually play with it and uh play with time.","We see when she spins it forward, she finds that she's pregnant, she gets a baby, she grows too old, she actually grows really old.","When she's on a wheelchair she tries to like reach for the record, but it's really hard and then she ends up being older where she can't even walk.","Now she has to use like the, you know, things old people use to walk.","And then when she spins it forward one more time, she ends up dead in a vase I guess to show us ashes, and like, you know we shouldn't play around with time.","We see when she reverses backwards at some point when she was a little girl, but she quickly reverses back to present time.","Ah yes so this is the record.","Uh, another movie I want to talk about is um, um, um.","Uhh like it if you post it?","Or post it if you love it?","Uh this is about this couple where the I guess a couple, the people they had like a crush on each other, they work in the same place and kind of like left each other sticky notes and all that.","And it was really romantic, uh this guy is in the bathroom and once the bathroom door closes he finds, he finds this little post-its and love signs and then kind of like retaliates and does the same for the lady when she comes back home and finds this huge post it with I guess it was green with like love signs and all that, and they're really liking each other.","So for the final one, she goes into the room, takes a lot of post-its, I think she wants to post on the wall of the picture of the two, maybe together cuddling, but she wants to, but she finds out that this guy already, you know already posted it, and then the movie ends up with her smiling as she's really flattered by this and I guess they just live happily ever after.","Um, the other movie I'm going to talk about is ooh.","Uhh, ohh, come on come on.","Ok I guess I'm done.","I didn't hear the last part, what did you say?","Ohh, okay, uhh."],"duration":{"_EnumKey_":["N/A"],"_EnumValue_":{"_ArraySize_":82,"_ArrayType_":"uint8","_ArrayZipType_":"zlib","_ArrayZipSize_":82,"_ArrayZipData_":"eJxjZKQ2AAANnQBT\n"}}}}},

I’m gonna call the police. Where are you?”","And then she’s like obviously kind of frantic and upset.","Then she throws the phone down on the ground.","The guy in the red t-shirt goes and picks it up and says, “Hey, this is a $60 phone, lady. Are you gonna pay me back for it?”","And then further down the road this car pulls up.","And this guy comes out who’s wearing like part of a tux but without the jacket, so just the black pants and like suspenders and a white shirt.","The lady goes to him, and the guy with the red shirt is kinda walking behind her.","And the lady is saying, “ Where is she? Where is she?”","And the guy who came out of the car is like, “Who’s this other guy?”","And the lady says, “Just a friend,” and the guy’s like, “What?","She's not my friend, she just borrowed my phone.","I wanted to see if I could get some money for it.”","Anyways, the, the guy who came out of the car and the woman start having this exchange.","And the guy who came out of the car says to the red-shirted guy, “Do you know who I am?”","And then he pauses for a second, and he's like, “Oh, you're the Great Aldino, and you're his assistant, like you guys are on TV.”","And then the, the woman kinda goes nuts and she pulls out a gun, and then the magician guy says, “Oh, well I have one too, like is yours loaded?” that kind of thing.","And then eventually the woman goes to the car.","She opens the trunk to, or she tries to open the trunk to look inside.","And the man with the red shirt now is with the magician, and the magician tells him to pay attention, and he pulls out this thing to hypnotize him.","It’s this box with like a cross on it with some type of bone thing inside.","And so he starts chanting to hypnotize the guy in the red shirt.","And meanwhile the woman has managed to open the trunk and sees something inside.","And the magician has hypnotized the guy who drops his bag with the ice cream in it which is all melted.","It goes all over the ground, and the guy drops on the ground and starts like pawing and twitching as if he’s a dog that’s asleep.","And the woman comes around from the car, and the magician is like, “Oh, crap,” because he probably said the wrong words when he was trying to hypnotize the guy.","And so he's like reading over what he should have said.","And the woman shoots him, and he shoots the woman, and they both fall to the ground.","And now the guy with the red shirt is acting like a dog, and licking the ice cream on the ground and starts barking and like sniffing around.","And then as he’s barking he starts hearing somebody else bark in return, or like some, somebody, some dog.","Anyways he starts crawling, and then this girl comes, also a dog now, obviously hypnotized by the magician.","And they start sniffing each other, as dogs do.","And then they go off down the street. Ok.","The clip before that was Post-It Love.","It starts with these two people who are making photocopies side-by-side in an office building.","And then they like both look up over the partitions that are slightly like lower than their heads, and look over at each other.","And then the, the, they all go off to their respective desks.","The first one the guy goes, and he sits down at his desk, and he opens a file, a file folder, and sees something inside ","which I didn’t note because I was distracted ‘cause the volume was loud, and then I asked Janice to turn down the volume.","The next time I kinda tuned in was when the woman was at her, going to her desk and then she like opened the curtains or the blinds and saw this flower that was made of post-it notes on her window.","And then the next kind of short part is the guy, who’s now in the bathroom, adjusting his tie.","Somebody goes into a stall, closes the stall door, and on the stall door is, I think, a purple heart or something else made of post-its.","And then there's another one that I’m not quite remembering.","Oh, the woman goes into like this, kinda closet like storage closet, opens the door, turns on the light and sees something else made of post-its that I’m not quite remembering.","And the last scene she's like carrying away this armload of post-it notes in all different colors.","And she's walking towards like the main area of the offices, and she looks, and there's this massive portrait of two people’s faces made completely out of post-it notes that takes up the entire wall.","And the guy is there adding a few final post-it touches.","And then they look at each other and smile.","The one before that is The Black Hole.","It also starts with a guy who is making photocopies and drinking coffee.","And the machine gets stuck or something, and then it produces a sheet of paper that has a large black hole on it.","The guy takes it, looks at it, puts it down, continues trying to make photocopies and drink his coffee.","Then he puts the cup on top of the, the black hole, and it disappears, and he's like, “Oh.”","Then he pushes his hand like in, through the paper with the black hole, reaches in, pulls his coffee cup back out.","And so he’s probably thinking, “Oh, this is kinda cool. I’ll, I wanna see what else I can do with it.”","So he looks around, sees a vending machine and takes the sheet of paper with the black hole, moves towards the vending machine, puts it over the glass and reaches in and grabs a candy bar.","Then he opens the candy bar, starts eating it, looks around at what else he can use this black hole for, and he sees this door that’s locked, and apparently contains a safe.","So he puts the black hole on top of the door, the, the wooden door, reaches through, unlocks it.","Then opens the door, goes through, and there's this small gray safe that’s at the bottom of the, like on the floor.","And then he takes the sheet with the black hole and puts it on top of the safe.","And it, at some point he must’ve gotten a piece of tape and I didn’t notice but the sheet of paper stays there, taped to the safe.","And he reaches his hand through, through into the safe and starts pulling out wads of cash.","And he pulls out more and more and more, puts them down on the floor.","He's getting kinda greedy, looks around seeing if anybody sees him.","Nobody’s coming, so he pulls out more and more and more money.","And then he's kind of reaching the end of the safe there, but he wants to see if he can get out just a little bit more.","So he starts to reach in further and further and actually goes into the safe.","And as he does so, his pants or his shirt catches the tape that he used to put the black hole on the safe.","And the, the sheet with the black hole comes down, and he's in the safe.","And now he's trapped in there, pounding on the door, and nobody comes to save him.","The one before that is The Prisoner.","It starts off with this guy, who’s in like this quirky little village.","And he is like at a cafe outside with these little tables.","And a woman comes.","And I forget the exact exchange they have at the beginning.","But he asks, I don’t remember exactly what he asks her, but eventually I think he asks her about a phone.","And so she tells him where the phone is, and he goes to, to make a phone call.","And when he goes to make a phone call, they ask him like what’s his number.","He doesn’t know what they're talking about, and he says like, “I don’t have a number,” and they say, “No number, no phone call.”","And so he's obviously confused, he doesn’t know where he is really, and so he's walking around looking kind of puzzled.","And then this woman pulls up in like this golf cart.","Oh no wait, before that he went to this little thing that has like different numbers pinned up with different keys that he could push and different descriptions as to what the numbers could bring.","And he's looking at that, and he pushes one of the numbers, and when he, when he does that, a woman pulls up in a golf cart.","And then he gets into the golf cart with her, and they start driving around.","And she asks him like where he wants to go, and I think he says France or something, and then she says like, “No, that’s international, we can't do that.”","And they have some kind of discussion at some point, I missed some of the words, but something about people like Czechs and Poles, and I don’t even remember why that came up, but then after she said that, she said, “Yeah, we’re quite cosmopolitan.”","And she's driving him around, and they see like somebody on a bike, and they're going through all these roundabouts.","And you see that they're in like this little village that has lots of funnily painted little shops, kinda like a little funhouse or toy thing.","Anyways, so they're, they're driving around, and eventually he like gets out, and he goes into this store.","And he sees this guy there, this like kind of heavy-set guy who’s behind the counter.","And he walks to the counter and he tells the guy that he wants a map.","And the guy asks him like, “What type of map do you want?”","And he’s like, “Whatever, just give me any map.”","And so the guy gives him a map, and the, the main character unfolds the map on the counter and looks at it and sees basically just some descriptions that say like, “Mountains,” “Village,” and just like a caricature of like a small town.","And he tells the guy, “No, can you give me like a larger map?”","So he obviously wants to see more area, like what surrounds the village.","And the guy asks him again, “Like what type of map? Like do you want it in color or something like that?”","And he says, “Whatever, like just give me a map. I just want it to be like a larger area.”","And he gives him the map, and he opens it, and it’s like a bigger, like a physically bigger map, like larger, but it doesn’t have more space around the town.","And he's like, “You know, I wanna see more area.”","And I’m blanking on how this one ends.","It might’ve ended just about there, but the guy behind the counter probably makes some comment, but I, I don’t remember what it is.","Ok, so the one before that was the one with the rock.","So it starts off with this massive rock, who is kind of, the rock is like personified as, you know, a person.","So the rock has eyes and a nose, and I don’t know if it has a mouth.","It definitely has eyes and a nose.","And it’s a huge rock, and its looking out over like this quaint little stream, and there's like life around and this little green creature that pops up from the water and goes onto a rock and then pops back in.","And the rock is like getting kind of tired, and so he closes his eyes to sleep.","And as he's sleeping, the earth undergoes massive changes, like, you know, the, the ice age and like dinosaur ages and so on.","It kind of moves through many, many different stages, like millions and millions of years.","And then when the rock wakes back up, it’s been millions of years, and so he’s kind of worn away to a much smaller rock than he was initially.","And he wakes up because there are, is somebody on his back who is chopping down this little tree that was like growing out of the rock.","And then the rock is probably annoyed, because he’s been woken up out of his sleep.","And then there's people that are next, that are by him, building away, making things.","And then the rock like kind of, I think he gets up, but he moves away to somewhere else and goes to try to sleep somewhere else, like pulling up against a tree or something like that.","And, but then he’s kind of taken away by other people and carted away where he’s made into a component of some kind of like mill or something that grounds I guess grains or something like that.","I’m not sure what it is, like this thing rotates, and I think he grinds grains into flour or something like that.","So he spends some of his life doing that, kind of rotating around and grinding things.","But then he’s taken away again, and now, the next time he’s fashioned into a cannonball.","He’s put into a cannon.","He’s shot off and lands somewhere.","I don’t remember where, but the rest of the clip is basically about the evolution of this rock’s life.","So after being in the cannonball, he ends up being like in a smaller rock.","And I think he ends up being on the beach at some point.","Oh no, he’s, he’s kicked by some guy who is walking along the street, so now the rock is much smaller, and the guy kicks him.","He’s clearly frustrated at something.","And the rock eventually goes through like this window, maybe after the guy kicks him, goes through this window, hits a guy who’s having like dinner with his significant other, and then like rolls out of the window.","And eventually the rock ends up in a beach, and now he’s very, very tiny, in among the sand.","And this, a machine comes and scoops up a bunch of sand, which it’s clear is going to be made into glass.","And so this rock, now this tiny little rock is poured into fire, and fashioned into a glass lens or window of some sort that is put onto like a space shuttle that’s launched into space.","And it goes through, you know, like I guess the atmosphere, and burns up and whatever.","Eventually it hits another planet, and it hits another planet, the glass comes apart.","And now this rock somehow, I’m not sure how, but it somehow trans-, it, it transforms into another enormous rock, exactly like the one that was in the beginning.","And now again he’s in front of a stream, looking fondly on as it kind of rolls away in front of him.","Ok, so let me make sure I described all of the ones in the last bit.","The rock, the post-its, the black hole, the prisoner, the bus stop, okay.","So now to the first 25 minutes.","Let me see if I can remember those.","Alright, the first one was Catch Me If You Can.","I’ve never seen the movie, so I, I assume the game show part was part of the movie, but there was like two related segments.","The first part was Catch Me If You Can game show with three contestants, who I guess are trying to compete for the part of somebody named Frank, Frank Williams Abagnale.","The middle one is Leonardo DiCaprio, and I’m really bad with names, so I don’t know who the other two actors are.","But they're introduced and then, ","the, the voiceover says something about the background of this Frank Williams, I don’t know if it’s Williams, Frank something Abagnale character about how he impersonated a bunch of different jobs,","I think including something like a judge maybe or someone high up in court, maybe a surgeon, and something else, I don’t know, all, all pretty high positions.","Anyways, the three people, who are all dressed as like navy captains or something like that, they move behind three different podiums, and they have a seat.","And this woman starts asking them questions.","The first question she asked the first contestant is something like, “Why, why did you try to go for all those professions?”","And he’s like, “It comes down to dollars and cents.","I guess those are the ways that I could make a lot of money.","And she goes to Leonardo DiCaprio’s character, and she says something about like, “How does it feel when you were finally caught?”","And then he, he mentions the name of the person who caught him, Carl, Carl Hambur, Hamley, something like that.","And then it cuts away to Tom Hanks, who is this Carl something character, who is wearing like gray raincoat and has an umbrella, and he’s outside, and he's getting rained on.","And he, I think, is trying to get into the prison to see this Frank character.","And so he’s, he’s taken in by like a policeman, and he’s shown to the cell where, where Frank is hidden away.","We don’t see him at this point, but he’s shown like a little stool, and he’s told that he can sit there, that there is like this little doorway thing, which he isn’t allowed to pass anything through to the prisoner, but he can sit there and talk to him.","And so the Tom Hanks character, Carl, I think, whatever, is sitting there, ","and then he brings out like this book, and I think he starts reading him something about like different articles, something that is clearly, I guess, relevant to his case or how he's gonna be tried or something.","And now we see Frank like holed up in his little cell, with long straggly hair, really, really sick, like coughing a lot.","His cough sounds really phlegmy and gross.","So he’s coughing a ton, and the Tom Hanks character is sitting out front trying to read him through like these different articles.","And at some point it like starts to like drizzle on him or something, so he takes out his umbrella, pulls it up, puts it on top of him and starts reading.","And his cough gets really, really, really bad.","And then eventually, and by his I mean Frank’s cough gets really, really bad.","And then he like falls forward, and the Carl character says like, “Oh, somebody come, like we need help. We need to take him to a hospital.","","And so they pull Frank out of the little cell and take him to like the hospital ward.","And they're saying like they have to get him some treatment.","They have to get him to America or something like that.","And then the Carl character is saying something about how he worked really hard to get him here, and they can't lose him.","And they're kind of conversing a while with the curtains pulled around Frank.","And then the next time they check behind the curtains, he’s gone.","And then the next scene we see is like Frank who is like coughing, still like coughing his lungs out, running very slowly, kind of stumbling through, trying to escape, going through like the prison with all of the other prisoners yelling like, “Frank, Frank, Frank.","And he's like stumbling, trying to get away.","But then all of the, the other policeman and the detective or whoever, they are coming up behind him, obviously gonna catch up with him.","But he's still trying to get away, and then he like drops down to the floor and tries to crawl away really slowly.","But eventually they get to him, and he falls backward.","I don’t remember anything after that, so I think it must’ve ended then.","Ok.","The next one, I think it was The Record.","So it starts with this, this was a cartoon, and starts with like this redheaded girl who’s in her little like apartment, ","and she has a box of pizza, and she opens it, and she gets out a slice, and then she’s gonna start to eat, but she gets some mail.","And so she goes to her door, and opens the door and gets her mail out, then sits back on her seat and pulls out a record.","It’s called A Single Life, and she puts the record on the record player and starts to play it.","And then she's listening, she’s listening, and it kind of skips a little bit to a different song.","And she notices that when it does that, her pizza kind of like disappears.","Well it doesn’t disappear, but the slice in her hand goes down to like close to the crust.","And then when she adjusts the, like the needle on the record player, it kind of grows back.","And so she messes around with this for a bit, and she notices that she could make the bit of the pizza go up and then disappear again and come back up and disappear again.","And so she starts messing around with the record player a bit more, and notices that she could make the entire pizza including like the bit in the box disappear and then come back, and disappear and then come back.","So she skips around a little bit more.","And then suddenly when she skips, she’s now in a completely different apartment.","It’s like fancier and like all sleek and posh, and she's like well dressed, and she has a baby.","Well, I mean, she’s pregnant, she doesn’t have a baby, but she's pregnant.","And then she skips around with the needle again, but the, the record player’s always there in front of her.","So she, she skips again, and then she’s no longer pregnant.","And then she’s pregnant again, she's no longer pregnant.","And then she decided to skip ahead until she already has a baby in her arms, and she's no longer pregnant.","But then like the baby starts wailing and crying, and she's like, “I don’t wanna have anymore of this.”","And so she skips again, and then she's like a little child, little like two-year-old or a toddler.","Again, the record player is in front of her, but she's like in, you know, a child’s room.","And she's probably thinking like, “No, I don’t want this either,” and so she tries to skip ahead to the record again, but her little arms can barely reach it, but eventually she gets it.","And she forces the record to skip again, and this time she’s an old lady, old lady in a wheelchair, and she’s probably thinking, “No, I don’t want this either.”","And so she tries to move forward to make the record like kinda skip again to like a different track.","But the record keeps jumping on its own, and every time it does that, it kind of moves her back in time, so she moves forward in her armchair, in her wheelchair, but then is forced to jump back in time.","She does that a few bits, and it’s like she’s stuck in this loop.","But eventually she gets it to, to skip ahead to like another track.","And this time again she's an old lady in a walker, ","and I don’t remember what happens from here.","I feel like she might’ve fallen, but I'm not 100% sure.","That’s all I can remember from that one.","Ok.","The next one, ok, so I think it’s the boyfriend one.","So it’s this woman who’s sitting at a table across from her, I guess it’s her husband not her boyfriend, although I think the clip was called The Boyfriend, because he has the wedding ring.","Anyway, they're sitting across from each other, and they're having dinner.","And she asks him if he wants a glass of wine, and he's like, something like, “No, I’m on call tomorrow,” or “I’m on call,” or something like that, so he can't have wine.","So she pours herself a glass of wine, and she downs the whole thing really quickly while looking at him and then pours herself some more wine.","And then he's eating kind of methodically, kind of robotically, and she's looking at him.","And then I think she asks him something about how he likes the dinner or something, and he's like, “It’s really good. The asparagus is quite tender.”","And she's like, “Yeah, they say it’s an aphrodisiac,” and he's like, “Who’s they?”","And she's like, “I don’t know, just something they say.”","Anyways, they are talking a little bit.","I don’t remember what else they talk about specifically, but she's obviously getting really annoyed with him.","She's like, you know, “Why can't you just like have a drink?","","","And then she throws some, like part of her wine on him.","And then he takes out a cigarette, puts it in his mouth, lights it.","And she's like, “Oh no, you're not smoking in my house.”","And I guess she somehow puts out the cigarette, I don’t remember how.","But then he puts another in, and he lights it.","And she's getting like really, really annoyed.","And I don’t remember the next few details, but eventually she like, she goes up to him, and we find that he has like a switch in the back of his neck, which she turns off, and he like, you know, stops functioning, because apparently he’s like a robot.","And she thinks, probably, she probably thinks to herself, “Well I can do better than this.”","And so she goes to her computer and she logs on to this website where you can buy your robotic boyfriend, husband.","So she sits down, and she's like browsing all the better options that she could get.","So she finds like a later model that is probably better, and this guy who is like a rock climber or something like that.","And she calls up and says that she's like not happy with her current model, and she’d kind of like an upgrade.","And they're like, “What’s your complaint?”","And she's like, “You know, he's like lacking ambition,” and they're like, “Yeah we get this complaint a lot with that series.","","And she's like, “Yeah, I think so.”","And they're like, “What would you like?” and she’s like, “I don’t know, maybe a rock climber.”","And then she like clicks through, and she’s like, she sees like a masseuse, and she's like, “No wait, maybe a masseuse or a rock-climbing masseuse.”","And then she gets a delivery later of her new robotic boyfriend, husband person.","And then they're taking away her old one, but she, she takes the wedding ring off the old one and puts it on the new one.","And the new one is like this all outdoorsy type guy, who is now carted in and put in the same seat where her old robotic husband boyfriend person was.","And she sits down across from him on the table, after she turns on the switch of course.","And then he's kind of slow getting started, a little bit methodical.","But then he like you know, comes to life.","And she asks him if he wants a drink.","And he's like, “No, I can't. I have a, I have a climb tomorrow.","And she's probably thinking like, “Oh no, here we go again.”","Then he takes a bite of his asparagus, and he's like, “Mmm, this is tender.”","And then she's probably thinking at this point like, “I can't believe he's having this, we’re having this conversation again.”","But then he looks up at her, and he's like, “They say its an aphrodisiac.”","And she's like happy now, smiling a little bit and says, “Who’s they?”","And he's like, “I don’t know. It’s just something they say.","And then he gets up and goes around the long table to her and stands behind her, and is like, “How was your day?”","And she's like, “Oh,” ‘cause she’s like obviously happy to be having this conversation, pleased with her new purchase.","And she's like, “Oh, this morning, I was like, I went into the shop to get some stuff to get ready for tonight.”","Oh, I forgot to mention it’s her anniversary, that’s why they were having this dinner.","And I think part of the earlier complaint was something about like, “Oh, it’s our anniversary. Can't you just have a drink?”","Anyway, they're back to the current moment.","She’s like, yeah, she went shopping to get stuff for tonight.","And he's like massaging her shoulders as she's talking.","And she's clearly very pleased with the massage.","He keeps on massaging her, and she's talking, and then his hands get closer and closer to her neck.","And then we find that he switches her off.","So her face drops forward, and then the camera zooms around behind her, and we see that she also has a switch at the back of her neck.","And dude’s apparently very smart, because he turned her off to shut her up, and then he goes forward and sits himself down on the armchair in front of the TV, turns it on, and starts watching.","Alright, the next one I think was The Shoe.","So it starts off with this guy’s shoe, that’s what we see.","Some, the text in the top left says something about like where, where it began, or where it ends up.","I think it’s where it began, I can’t remember.","But the guy’s there.","The guy’s shoe, he’s leaning against a car.","And he's like super tough, and so he's drinking milk.","So he's opening this carton of milk and drinking the milk while propped up against the car.","And then this guy comes out, and then apparently the dude who’s drinking the milk, it’s not his car, it’s somebody else’s car, and he chases him away, and so the guy who’s drinking the milk walks away from the car, still drinking the milk.","At some point he noticed this woman who was across the street and decided that he wanted to impress her or something.","So he's walking along, looking at her, kind of stumbles a bit.","And he looks towards her, and then she stumbles a bit, kind of like making fun of him.","And then he does a few more things that she starts to copy, like I think he starts swinging his hands or something like that.","And then she starts swinging her hands and looking over at him.","And then she starts like waving her arms behind her back and like bending over, and then he waves his arms behind his back and in front of him and bends over.","And so they keep walking along this street.","Each one is copying what the other one’s doing, clearly having fun and laughing.","And then they get to an intersection, and she stops suddenly.","And she clearly wants him to stop, because otherwise he’s gonna walk right in front of this truck.","And so she stops, hoping that he’ll stop, and then she like raises her arms up, acts surprised and shocked and trying to like get him to imitate her, which would mean that he’d stop.","But he is having so much fun that he doesn’t stop, he just keeps walking forward.","He keeps walking into the intersection, is hit by a truck, shoe flies off.","You see the shoe land in the street, and the camera pans a little bit, and then we see a woman’s shoe that’s next to it.","Alright, the last one, Keith Reynolds.","So, a little stick figure in a car drives up to a building, gets out of the car, and gets its hat and its briefcase.","It’s Keith Reynolds, and Keith Reynolds is really excited, because he is looking forward to his promotion that day.","He is the most junior type of business analyst, and he's like really, really waiting for this promotion that he knows is gonna happen today.","So he walks in, and we see kind of a cut through of his building.","So we see the many different floors of the office building that he’s working in and the people on the different floors.","And he gets into his elevator, and he, he goes up, and he gets out, and there's this woman, who’s a pink stick figure, bending over and like putting some stuff in or taking some stuff out of a cabinet, or something like that.","Her name’s Sara, and Keith wants to impress Sara.","So he wants to get this promotion, and he wants to impress this girl.","And so he walks in, and he always tries to get her to talk to him.","And he tries to make her know that she should spend the rest of his life, her life with him.","And the way he does that is by always offering her coffee.","And so he offers her coffee as he always does.","She never wants any, but he offers it anyway.","She takes it.","We see her take the coffee, dump it out of the window.","Unfortunately, the hot coffee"],"duration":{"_EnumKey_":[8,7,4,6,10,5,3,9,14,11,13,12,15,21,18,2,17,16,1,19],"_EnumValue_":{"_ArraySize_":325,"_ArrayType_":"uint8","_ArrayZipType_":"zlib","_ArrayZipSize_":325,"_ArrayZipData_":"eJwNTwmOxDAMEgYfTTq7aWf//9ZFkaUgYw4ElaxQt+CpBqdK7A7NVbWqImBKBhgcxNYVwxu72ABy\n6bpneV8sCVFdahqGuFHx0YKC/WNZTcgn1XctZUrXjpqWbNQb84u8xu6H69F5d3JYuN/JB+lkpq4T\nZIQeW5BfJmwlKTcFf6gaS4ehXx/tyrtSpFMdF2TzT+MYB+zCyss0U8MiBIY6bhYF94lurz5Wsqph\n3a7gqj5/LQjagP0PavYHDg==\n"}}}}},

I needed the money” basically.","And then the contestant asked the second person, who is Leonardo Dicaprio, who is the true Frank.","Who chased him?","And that’s when he says, “Carl.”","And then it cuts to France, Marseilles, France, and it’s Tom Hanks’ character, Carl Hanratty, talking to the French police, trying to explain his name, and it’s raining and pouring, and he has an umbrella, and everyone’s soaking wet.","And it’s like the French police don’t seem to really understand what, what Carl Hanratty is saying.","Anyway, so after that, it’s Marseilles, France, 1969, he walk.","He’s in this like jail, and Frank is in the jail in one of the cells, like maximum seclusion.","And one of the officers takes Carl to the front of the, Frank’s cell, and says, “Sit here on the stool,” and he opens this little trap door thing, and he's like, “Don’t pass anything through there.”","And Carl sits down, and he starts reading, what’s the word?","Like extradition stuff to Frank, because he’s gonna take him back to the U.S., because, well you don’t know this at that part, but later on in the movie you find out that he’s arrested by the police for printing money.","Anyway, I won’t get into that, but anyway he's going, getting, you know that he's getting extradited back to the U.S.","And while Carl is reading the extradition laws, Frank is coughing.","Eventually he falls over, and while he’s coughing, Carl’s like, “You're not fooling me.”","But then Frank eventually tips over, and Carl tosses away his stool and yells at the French policeman to like open the gate.","“This guy’s sick. Get him a doctor.”","And it cuts to like the police officers dumping Frank on a cot in like a sort of medical ward part of the prison.","And then they start rinsing their hands, and Carl’s like, “What are you doing?” and all the officers are like, “We’re getting rid of the lice.”","And Carl’s like, “He needs to see a doctor,” and they're like, “Well the doctor can see him in the morning.”","I forget if they say in the morning or, you know, after the weekend or something.","So they begin to argue a little bit, but then the camera pans over to an open door.","And so like Frank has slipped through the door.","The next scene is Frank running down the hallway of a prison, but he's like kind of limping and falling all over the place, so he's trying to escape, he wasn’t faking that, he really was sick.","Anyway, the police officers and Carl walk up to him.","And the head guy, the French police, holds like a pistol to the top of Frank’s head, and Frank just stops there, and like falls, like kind of leans down and lies on his back, back spread over, and he’s like, “Okay, Carl, you can take me home.”","And so that’s the end of that.","Okay so the next movie, or short film I remember, I think it was called like The Record.","It’s like sort of Claymation, and it’s this young lady, who is about to eat some pizza, and she gets a knock on her door.","And she opens the door, and all that’s there is this manila envelope.","And in the manila envelope, she opens it, and there's a record.","So she, it’s a small, it’s like a 7-inch, so she puts the record on.","She has a record player conveniently next to her pizza, and she starts playing it.","And she's about to like take a bite of the pizza, and the pizza like has disappeared, like halfway disappeared.","And she notices this, and she like looks at the record, and then she like reruns, she like sort of like rotates the, you know, the record around to like sort of rewind it.","And the pizza comes back, and then she like fast forwards, and the pizza goes away, and she does that back and forth a couple times.","And now I'm forgetting the lyrics of the song, but it’s something like, “Don’t rush” or “Take your time,” which is obviously directly related to what the record is doing, fast-forwarding and rewinding time relative to like where in the song the needle is.","So then she like skips ahead, and it’s to the point where you like see a picture frame, she's married.","And then it like pans down, and she's pregnant, and she like fast forwards and rewinds, and her stomach like grows and shrinks.","And then she, you know, skips ahead a little bit, and the baby pops like into her arms.","And she seems like pretty pleased at that point, and like this is pretty cool.","And then she like, I think that’s when she rewinds, and she's like back to a little kid.","And like every time it sort of jumps in time, the record player is there, and like she had the baby when she was older, but now as a kid, she has like a little doll in her hand.","And so then she has to, but she's like really short, so she like goes on her tippy toes to like reach and like move the record needle.","And then she skips ahead a lot, and she’s older.","And she's like broken her leg I think in a wheelchair, and she's like wheeling the wheelchair over, but then of course the record skips, and so it like rewinds, and that goes back and forth a couple times, which is like pretty clever.","And then, and then I think it just, I forget if she bumps the record player or something, but it skips ahead, and she's much older, and there's a walker.","But obviously like after a second or two she realizes, “Oh man, the record’s almost done playing.","And so she's like trying in the walker to get to the record player in time, but then the record ends, and she, you know, she changes into an urn.","And that’s the end of the short, so that was pretty cute.","So that was all Claymation.","The next one that I remember was The Shoe.","I can't remember if there was one in between those, but The Shoe was pretty cool.","So it starts with like a shoe lying like kind of in the street.","It’s a Velcro shoe, and after like a second or two, there’s text on the screen that says something like, “This is how the shoe got there.”","And there's a song that starts playing, and I recognize the song, it’s like one of the theme songs from the movie Four Rooms.","It’s pretty funny, because like it has the same exact comedy as the movie Four Rooms.","I don’t know if that was influential, but it’s like, it starts with this guy drinking a little carton of milk.","And he's like leaning on a car, and he's watching the lady across the street, and some guy comes out, who obviously it’s his car, and shoos the guy who’s drinking the milk away from the car.","And then the guy starts walking down the sidewalk looking over at the lady, and she's looking back at him.","And like at first they're kind of doing some like weird, they both stumble, and they sort of have a weird spastic move.","And he like, while that’s going on, he puts his milk on a fence as he's walking.","But then they start sort of, it becomes more clear that they're dancing, stumbling intentionally.","It sort of goes with the music as it’s going along, and they're sort of playing along, and at one point, she goes behind, I don’t know what those things are called, they’re boxes sometimes in the street.","I think they might have electrical equipment in it.","Anyway, big metal box, so she disappears for a second but then comes out, and I think she has her hand like on her head, and it’s sort of like, I don’t know, mimicking some sort of dance from the 50s and he mimics her.","And they're going and going and going, and then she's getting to the end of like the block.","She sees this car sort of swerving behind the guy as he gets to, you know, across the street to the end of the block also, and it’s at an intersection.","And of course like, she's like, “Oh my gosh,” like she puts her hands up to her face like, “Oh my gosh,” and like the guy walks out into the street and then gets hit by the car.","And then like pretty funny but absurd, the car like goes over some lift and like flips over and like kind of like an action scene sort of thing.","And then like you see the body flip into the air. I don’t think you see it land, but then like you see the shoe.","And then like the camera sort of pans a little bit further down the block and there's another shoe, so maybe it’s implying that that happened another time.","Alright, so that was basically that one.","And then there was this like sort of stick figure film.","I forget what the guy’s name, it’s all about this guy.","Ralph or I don’t remember.","I didn’t really like this one.","So it’s like a stick figure, and it starts off with like a voiceover saying, “This person will not be making it tonight,” I can't remember if it says “making it to dinner” or something, but like obviously something’s gonna happen to this guy.","Anyway, so it’s driving up, it’s sort of panned out, car drives up to this tall building.","And the voice, it’s a total narration from just this voiceover character describing what this guy’s doing, so he gets out of his car.","He walks into the lobby, there's like two other stick figures that are like not doing it very well but trying to toss some trash into a waste-bin next to a desk with a sort of security guard check-in guy.","The narration’s saying something like, “It’s this guy’s big day, you know, because he’s going to get a promotion.”","Or at least that’s what he thinks he’s gonna get.","And he walks into the elevator, and it’s describing like sort of internal feelings about the guy.","And then it stops off at like I think the fourth floor and describes how there's a female coworker that he really likes, that he like makes coffee for and she never really, she doesn’t want him to make coffee for her.","It’s not really clear at that point whether she like has any feeling for her, but he’s convinced that he's gonna get this promotion, and then she's gonna be attracted to him, because he's like right now only sort of an assistant partner or something.","But he's gonna get promoted to something much more notable.","Anyway, he gives her some coffee.","She obviously doesn’t want it.","She walks over to the window and pours it out onto like one of those guys who’s like maybe a window cleaner guy, um, it’s not scaffolding, but, you know, something.","He falls over, and the camera pans a floor below or something to some other guy who like sees the person fall over.","And at first isn’t sure if it’s a person or an object, looks out the window, yeah it’s a person, and then he calls the police.","This is all said by the narrator, though.","Alright, and then the guy walks to the elevator, takes the elevator up.","And it’s like talking, the narrator starts talking about the handshake, and there's another guy that he passes, who’s like green.","They're all, the stick figures have like solid colors.","I forget what the main character was, maybe orange, and that guy looks like he just got good news.","He may have seen, I think it may have cut to when he was just handshaking the boss.","Anyway, so, so main character goes into the boss’ office, and I kind of forget the order of things, but like.","The narrator’s like, “That was a weaker handshake than he was expecting,” and while basically the main character finds out that he's not getting the promotion, ","the green guy who just got a promotion goes down to the floor with the female coworker who the orange guy is interested in, and she like starts making out with him.","So anyway, the orange guy is like very distraught about this, and he thinks, “Oh, maybe I’ll go down and this lady will console me,” or maybe just talking to her will make him feel better, something like that.","Anyway, he, he takes the elevator, elevator opens up, and he sees the two kissing, and he's like, like really shocked about that.","And there's some comment about how like that moment, it feels like the elevator doors are taking forever to close.","Anyway, and then like there's a narration like, the orange guy’s like wondering what would happen if like, what it would feel like to be stuck in that inclined, small enclosed place with the green guy.","And then of course then the green guy like walks towards the elevator, and he's like, “Hey, hold the elevator.","And they both get in.","And they go back up a couple floors, and as the green guy is getting off, the narrator says, “Orange guy couldn’t believe what he said, like those three words that he’d never thought he’d say to anyone,” and he's probably like, “Fuck you buddy,” or something.","Anyway, the orange guy, the green guy turns around and punches the orange guy in the face.","Then the orange guy, who’s the main character, starts punching the green guy, and you see little splatters of blood on the elevator.","Eventually, basically the green guy is killed by the end, the orange guy slams his briefcase on the green guy.","So this is all in the elevator, and the orange guy’s like, “Uh oh,” or the narrator’s basically describing how the orange guy’s sort of freaking out about what he’s gonna do, ","and so he decided to like drag him and take him home and then decide what to do with the body.","So at this point I think maybe he starts to take the guy down the stairs, because he doesn’t want to take him down the elevator, because the security guard on the first floor will like obviously see this.","He starts going down some the stairs, and then the camera pans down a couple floors to some lady, who needs to use the bathroom.","And she really likes the bathroom on the eleventh floor because of the soap dispensers.","And because of her New Year’s promise, she starts taking stairs, so she starts walking up the stairs.","And right around the sixth floor they cross paths, and she faints and falls down the stairs and dies.","And the orange guy like, this is all by the narrator, is like, the narrator says the orange guy feels bad about that, but really can’t blame himself.","Anyway, so they're now like on the sixth floor, and the orange guy sees a conveniently placed ladder.","And he takes the green guy over to that, and as that’s going on, the, the love interest of the green guy misses him, decides to take the elevator up to see him.","Elevator opens up, and she, or, I don’t know if you even see her take the elevator, but you see her see them.","The orange guy and green guy’s now near the window.","And she sees this and faints, and the narrator’s like, oh yeah, and like the orange guy realizes that dead bodies make women faint or something like that.","Anyway, so then orange guy tosses the green guy out of the window onto the ladder, and I think somehow swings himself out there at the same time.","And so, but then he falls, or sort of falls a story or two while holding onto the ladder, and the ladder tilts away from the building.","It’s all very precarious, and then at that point the narrator, like the narrator’s discussing how like, the orange guy’s having this deep insight that, you know, ","he spent eight years here and like he's always trying to like make it, you know, get a better promotion and better salary or something.","And now the orange guy realizes that’s just what everyone’s sort of doing, and like, you know, everyone wants that for themselves.","The green guy, who’s dead now, wants it.","He’s staring at some guy through the window, obviously that guy wants, wants, he's like the janitor guy or something mopping the floors, wants just something better for his life.","And then it cuts out there, like he doesn’t fall, but presumably that’s what eventually happens.","Alright, let’s see.","I’m gonna probably go out of order here now, because the next one that I'm remembering is the Post-It Love thing, and that was very cute.","It starts off with like these two office coworkers, and they're making photocopies.","And they like bend over at the same time to refill the paper into the tray, and then I think they look up over at each other, there's this sort of like cubicle divider thing, and then they quickly look down.","It’s like this sort of flirty, you know, obviously they're attracted to each other.","Anyway, there's a song going on through all of this, it’s not spoken.","And it’s like weirdly sort of dated almost, like their outfits, it’s kind of like the 50s, but modern also.","Anyway, while this is going on, like basically now, I think after the photocopying, it goes to the guy’s desk, and he opens a folder, and there’s like a smiley face in the folder made of post-its, ","and he like looks at it for a little bit, and then he like sort of scoots back on his chair, so he's like outside of his cubby, and he's sees her outside of her cubby in the chair in a similar position just down the hallway.","And then they quick, they both sort of scoot back in to their desks.","And then the next thing is I think she’s like walking in, or maybe it’s the next day, and she raises the blinds, and it’s like a sun made out of the post-its.","And then the next scene, he’s in the bathroom straightening his tie, and then like a guy goes into a bathroom stall, and closes it, and it’s like a post-it that’s like, like a, you know, a cartoon bubble where you’re thinking, and there’s a heart in the bubble.","And then the next one is she goes into like the supply closet, and when she turns on the light, as her like, the way the camera’s posed with her hand like you know basically turned on the light string.","It’s in a good position that like it matches on the wall there's like some flowers, so it’s like she's holding these flowers.","The flowers are of course made out of post-its.","Anyway, so she grabs a whole bunch of post-its.","They're like, her hands are full of them, and she’s walking, you know, sneaking out of the supply closet walking down the hallway.","And then she stops and she's looking, and then it like cuts across, and the guy has made this big mural of their two faces out of post-its.","And you know, it’s kind of close up of his face, and he's like surprised, but then like the camera shows both of their faces, and they're smiling, and basically that’s the end of that.","It’s very cute.","Okay, so before that, now I'm remembering there was the Black Hole.","And so that also started with a guy at a copy machine, and it was like very sort of green, blue filtered to set this mood of this guy working in a dingy office.","He kind of looks like Bob Odenkirk.","So he's making photocopies, and out of the photocopier comes basically this big, black dot on a white paper.","It’s, you know, it’s the exact album cover of Bad Brains’ Black Dots.","Anyway, he puts it to the side.","He’s drinking like a disposable cup of, I don’t know, something, coffee.","And he puts, he like drops it down, and it goes through the thing.","And he doesn’t realize it at first, and then he looks, and he’s like, “Woah, what happened to it?”","There's no speech in this.","So he like reaches in and picks out his cup, and he’s like examining it for a while, like clearly sort of processing what this thing is doing.","But then pretty quickly he just goes over to the vending machine, and puts it, puts the black dot up to the vending machine, reaches in, and gets a whole bunch of snacks.","The snickers bar is one of the ones he starts eating.","And when he puts his hand in, there's like a particular sound, like “whr whr whr” or something.","Anyway, so the next thing, he looks over at this door, that’s like a Do Not Enter door.","And he puts the paper on the door, and reaches in and unlocks the door.","Behind the door is a security safe.","So he like puts the paper on the security safe, and starts taking out money.","And they're not dollars, they're like pounds or something, so like it’s a European film, short film.","And he’s like taking out all the money, all the money.","Eventually he's like reaching further into the back, and then he sort of starts to crawl in.","And then he crawls in fully into it, but as he’s crawling in fully, the paper just had one piece of scotch tape that was holding it up, it falls under, it falls off.","And the tape falls, the, the paper falls to the ground.","And he's stuck in the safe.","And that’s the end of that one.","Okay, before that, I'm now remembering there was something called the Boyfriend.","And so that starts off in, I don’t know, they were like, either French of German, I think they were German accents.","It was like at nighttime, and this lady and what seems to be her boyfriend, or husband, they're eating dinner, and it’s their anniversary.","And they're like sitting, it’s like a rectangle table, and they're like sitting at the ends.","Why do, do people really ever do that in real life?","Anyway, so they're sitting at different ends, and she offers him some white wine, and he's like, “No, I'm on call tonight.”","And she's like, kind of like gives a face of annoyance.","And then she just downs her glass of wine and fills it up again.","And then I think, I forget like, if it’s right then or shortly afterwards, she's just like, “You know, you’re not even a doctor. You’re like a data, you're a computer person, you know, like what does that mean to be on call?” sort of thing.","Anyway, so then she says something like, “Oh.”","Or he says, “The asparagus are really good tonight. They're tender.”","And she's like, “Oh I hear they're an aphrodisiac.”","And he's like, “Who says that?” as in he doesn’t believe her, and she's like, “I don’t know, just people.”","And then he's like, “Okay,” like obviously not reciprocating the sort of like sexual like cute flirtatious talking, so she's like totally not happy about that.","And then he asks something like, “How was your day?” and then she like tosses the wine at him.","And she's like, “You're so stale,”","and weirdly, I guess I skipped this, when the film started, it said, “The Boyfriend,” and then it said something like “high maintenance.”","But, it didn’t really seem to describe the boyfriend.","Anyway, it could be reflecting actually her.","So he gets upset from the wine tossed on his face and starts lighting a cigarette, and she's like, “Don’t you smoke in my apartment” and takes the cigarette, and then walks and puts it in an ashtray, and then he takes out another one and lights it.","And then she just sits back down and looks at him.","And I don’t think he says anything, and eventually she's like, “I’m sorry,” or I know.","She says something about, you know, “We’re just gonna have robotic sex,” you know, something, and he gets like really upset about that.","It might’ve happened right before he had the cigarettes, I can't remember.","Anyway, so after a moment, she gets up and she's like, “Oh, I'm so sorry,” and sits down on his lap.","And she's like, “I didn’t mean that,” about the stale sex, and then she's like rubbing the back of his neck, and then she like switches him off.","He's a robot.","That’s when you find out he's a robot.","And then she goes over to, I think maybe she takes another sip of wine or something, and then she goes over to her Apple computer laptop.","And she's looking online at, it’s like Proteus Robotics and there's a slogan about love for all your love needs or something.","Prometheus, not Proteus, Prometheus Robotics: For all your love needs.","So it’s like a website for a company, and clearly like this robot was from that company, and she's looking at other models, and she calls up, ","and she's like, you know, “I'm not satisfied with my model,” and they're like, “What’s the problem?” and she says something about, “He's not spontaneous or anything,” ","and they're like, “Oh that’s like the 100 model. Yeah that’s a known defect,” or something.","Anyway, she's like, “I'm looking to upgrade,” and they're like, “Well, what do you want?”","And she's being a little coy about it, like she knows the one that she wants.","She wants Paul, or the rock climber/masseuse, a little scruffy.","Anyway, so she's like, “Oh maybe a rock climber, or maybe a masseuse, or how about a masseuse and a rock climber?”","And then the camera pans out, and clearly like she's describing the guy that she wants, that she’s looking at on the computer.","Anyway, next scene, doorbell rings, she opens it up, and there are these two female delivery people with a box.","And clearly it’s the new guy, and so they package up the old guy.","And as they're about to take him away, she's like, “Wait.","And I think she like gives him a kiss goodbye and takes off the wedding ring.","That’s why it’s a little confusing, like why this is the Boyfriend, because they're married.","Anyway, she puts the ring on the new guy’s finger, and then puts him in the chair, and then starts him up, and sits down at the table.","And then there's a delay of a second while he’s sort of like boots up.","And then he like turns on, and then he starts eating the asparagus.","And he's like, “Ah, the asparagus, they're tender tonight.”","And then he's like, “I hear they're an aphrodisiac,” or.","There was something that I think he said beforehand that she like, maybe she just, like he said, “The asparagus are tender tonight,” and she's like immediately sort of disappointed, like, “Oh no, here we go again,” ","but then he says, oh, yeah he says, “I hear they're an aphrodisiac,” and then her eyes perk up, and she's like, “Oh, who tells you that?” and he's like, “Oh you know, just people.”","So they're sort of flirting.","And then, oh I know what happened, she offered him white wine first, and he's like, “No, I got a rock climb tomorrow. I can't have any.”","And so she was like disappointed from that, but then the asparagus comment perked her up.","So then I forget what, yeah I forget why, but he gets up basically and starts massaging her.","And as he's massaging her, I forget, she might’ve said something.","And he gets up, and he's like massaging her, and he's like, “Oh, so tell me about your day.”","And she starts telling him about his day, and like she saw her girlfriend, and.","But then the guy switches her off and it’s like, ah plot twist.","She's a robot too.","And then he like goes and sits down on the couch, and I think he like takes the bottle of wine with him and turns on the TV and starts watching sports.","That’s the end of that one.","Alright, next one I remember was the Prisoner.","So this one seemed like it was similar to Catch Me If You Can, not a short.","It seemed like it was part of an actual movie.","The guy, lead guy, looked like actually maybe some sort of famous actor.","Anyway, starts off where the guy is like in this small cute town, definitely European looking, talking to a lady.","And the lady might be like sweeping stuff or something.","And like he asks her where there's like a phone, and she's like, “Around the corner,” and he like goes around the corner.","It’s a weird sort of mod dated sort of thing, but then he picks up a phone that’s like clearly from the 80s or something.","So there's like weird mixing of time pieces.","Anyway, he speaks to an operator, and like the operator is like, needs him to like provide some sort of number of something, and he's like asking where he is or something, and the person’s like, “Can you give me your access number?”","And he's like, “I don’t have one,” and the person’s like, “Well then I can't help you,” and he hangs up.","And then he's like, clearly he doesn’t know where he is.","He's like almost like he just woke up in this strange land.","And so there's a like sort of digital board, it was weird, it sort of cut to that, I didn’t know what happened, but there's a digital board, and he presses some button, there's many buttons, sort of like typewriter buttons or something,"," and he presses one and this like golf cart taxi thing pulls up.","And there's this like Asian lady there.","And so far, it looked like everyone was British.","And then there's this Asian lady, and she has like eye makeup, very mod looking, so again like weird dated things.","Anyway, so she picks him up, and she's like, “Where to?” and he's like, oh I think sort of like, “Take me to the nearest city,” or something, and she's like, “Oh I'm only local.”","He's like, “Well then take me as far as you can,” and she's like, “Okay.”","And she's like starts taking him and starts describing the area, and like I think when she first pulled up, she spoke French to him, and he's like, “Why’d you speak French to me?” and she's like, “It’s an international language.”","And then she's like, starts talking about Poles and like other nationalities, and they like to visit here or something."],"duration":{"_EnumKey_":[11,3,8,10,15,14,6,5,2,18,9,7,17,12,4,23,21,16,19,13,1,20],"_EnumValue_":{"_ArraySize_":271,"_ArrayType_":"uint8","_ArrayZipType_":"zlib","_ArrayZipSize_":271,"_ArrayZipData_":"eJwNj1GOQzEIAxVgY/IguE3T3v+oy5+F0Wg8RG38TcB9ziWPajy5IxFilg4pvvrFCY+p71R3H8Ed\nGL6caYo8GtDibFKpSYrIznGS8TnkusOI43C795QeXwcRqhXuCL3KMb9VJiMlbDZ5H9hnm3/Tankt\n64KQUUyA2vk2V/PCL/jS9nhIJbenudYSK3QCUzOcrUnSZ7sh0GeJ1YM5u5dfb5sgwzjjH+7aCcY=\n"}}},"sub-08_task-recall_run-02_bold.nii.gz":{"_DataLink_":"https://neurojson.org/io/stat.cgi?action=get&db=openneuro&doc=ds004042&file=sub-08/func/sub-08_task-recall_run-02_bold.nii.gz&size=521166481"},"sub-08_task-recall_run-02_events.tsv":{"onset":[7.9,12.9,24.9,37.9,42.9,50.9,54.9,57.9,61.9,69.9,77.9,84.9,90.9,96.9,109.9,114.9,116.9,123.9,126.9,131.9,135.9,140.9,148.9,151.9,155.9,161.9,173.9,183.9,190.9,196.9,207.9,221.9,224.9,226.9,229.9,233.9,246.9,251.9,256.9,260.9,277.9,284.9,290.9,296.9,302.9,316.9,321.9,333.9,341.9,349.9,360.9,363.9,373.9,376.9,391.9,400.9,408.9,418.9,424.9,440.9,443.9,452.9,468.9,476.9,489.9,504.9,512.9,522.9,530.9,545.9,550.9,555.9,562.9,565.9,567.9,581.9,589.9,594.9,601.9,605.9,621.9,632.9,647.9,651.9,657.9,685.9,688.9,693.9,704.9,709.9,712.9,727.9,731.9,735.9,742.9,745.9,750.9,766.9,770.9,786.9,793.9,805.9,817.9,820.9,842.9,849.9,852.9,857.9,861.9,868.9,876.9,882.9,892.9,904.9,912.9,922.9,931.9,933.9,938.9,945.9,954.9,957.9,970.9,973.9,984.9,993.9,997.9,1008.9,1014.9,1018.9,1032.9,1040.9,1049.9,1057.9,1061.9,1063.9,1075.9,1078.9,1085.9,1092.9,1097.9,1106.9,1116.9,1124.9,1133.9,1139.9,1149.9,1157.9,1161.9],"recall_transcript":["Ok so, when we last left off I was talking about The Prisoner.","And we were at the point where the guy was picked up in this taxi, and this lady was talking to him about Poles and some other nationality of people that maybe frequent the town or something,","and she's like describing stuff and clearly, he's like not fully paying attention, and the camera keeps panning to her like it’s first person perspective of like the golf cart driving or something.","And so you're getting to see the scenery and the town, and some people are walking around and everything.","Anyway, so eventually, she's just talking to him, and eventually, he's not really saying much.","They get to like as far as she's willing to go.","And he gets out, and she's like, “That’ll be two credits.”","He's like, “Credits?” like obviously doesn’t know what that is.","And she's like, “Yeah whatever, I’ll, don’t worry about, you know, you'll pay next time,” and then she pulls away.","And then he like walks up this storefront and reads the, there's like some sort of welcome sign or something, and then he walks in.","And very, very subtly as he walks in, or maybe not so subtle, but the shopkeeper is talking to somebody else in another language.","I don’t know, might’ve been German or something, or I sort of missed it, but it’s definitely not English.","But as soon as the guy walks in, they stop talking in the other language and start talking in English.","Okay, and then, the guy walks over to another part of the counter, the main guy, and the shopkeeper walks around, and the other guy, the other customer leaves.","And the shopkeeper’s like, “How can I help you?” and the guy’s like, “Can you get me a map?” and the guy’s like, “Do you want color or black and white?”","And the guy’s like, “I don’t care. Whatever.”","And the guy pulls out a black and white map and gives it to the guy and the guy looks at the map, and it’s like very small map.","It’s not that big of a map, and it doesn’t cover a wide area.","Basically it shows the village.","I think it was called Your Village or something.","And then there are these mountains surrounding it, and maybe there's a coastline at one point also.","Anyway, the guy looks at it, and he's like, “No, I mean a much bigger map,” and he's like, “Alright, well all I have is in color then,” and the guy’s like, “Whatever, fine. Give me a map.”","So he gives him the color map.","It’s basically the same area of coverage, but just a much physically larger map.","And the guy looks at it, and again the camera pans to like the mountains and the village itself on the map.","And then the guy’s like, “No, I meant like a much larger area,” and the guy’s like, “Oh, sorry, all we have are the local maps, like nobody really cares about anything beyond that.”","And then I think the guy’s like, “Whatever, that’s, you know, whatever,” and starts walking out, and a new customer walks in, and the shopkeeper’s like, “alright, well see you again.”","And then the guy walks out, and that’s the end of that short.","Alright, so then there's totally at least one or two other ones.","And let me take like a second to try to remember what the last one was, I can’t believe I'm blanking on it now.","They were all called “The” something.","Oh I know, I totally forgot one called The Rock.","So that was an animation one.","That was way back when, that was like the first one of the second set.","Anyway, okay The Rock.","What happens in The Rock, it’s a cartoon where it starts off with this like mountain, gray mountain, rock mountain with a face on it, and the guy’s like, the rock’s seeming pretty tranquil.","There's a stream that’s running to it, and you see this weird crustacean thing.","So it looks like it’s like very primitive Earth.","The rock seems very peaceful and happy.","So the rock closes its eyes, and then there's like some swirling that goes on, and then the guy, the rock sort of wakes up, and he’s like now covered in earth, so not that tall anymore, and the guy, so there’s some earth on top of him.","And he, like grass and stuff, so he wakes up and he pops out of the ground.","And he starts walking around, and he’s much smaller now, he's just like a big boulder.","And there's like people in the background, looks like they're like farming or something.","At first I thought they might’ve been French, but they turn out to be he’s in the U.S.","Anyway, so he's walking around, he walks up against, he walks and he sees this like sort of hill thing, other rock, and he like sort of gets comfy and like leans up against it to like take a nap.","But the next thing he knows, somebody’s prying him off of that rock formation.","And it’s like all these different people that are like not really farmers but definitely like several centuries old.","And so they take it, take this rock, and you see it starts getting processed.","And he's turned into like a little rock wheel, that’s part of like, I forget what those things are called.","They're giant, wooden wheels that like take water and I think by the spinning of the water, I don’t know, they crush grain or something.","I forget what the name is for that stuff.","So clearly it’s like, I don’t know, 1700s or something based on that technology, and you see like there are rocks outside with faces as well.","Anyway, this thing’s going round and round and round.","And then some soldiers walk in, and they kind of look like French outfits, but it like clearly like it gets crushed down, the rock gets crushed down into like a cannonball, and then you see it’s actually like the Revolutionary War.","And yeah, so the rock gets fired out of a cannon and hits this other ship, the British ship.","I think it’s a British ship, I mean if it’s the Revolutionary War it had to have been, but it had a flag that looked weird.","Anyway, the ship sinks, the rock like goes down into the water, and I think the rock’s now a little bit fractured more.","Basically throughout the whole time, like through the course of events, the rock keeps getting more and more fractured.","Anyway, it’s in the water and it’s walking past another, another rock that has a face, and I forget what happens with the water.","Somehow it gets out of the water.","And it, it’s smaller again, and it's like it takes, it’s walking in a field, and it takes a nap on like a glove.","And then next thing the rock knows, a guy has picked him up and flips him over and like the rock actually has a fossil on the back, and so the guy who picked him up is super happy and puts him in a little like tool cabinet thing.","And now the rock is like on display in a museum with other rocks that are also fossils.","And then this little kid who’s missing a couple teeth like jumps up and like puts his face and hands right against the display and shakes the display, and the rock falls out from the back of the display.","And you know, falls down or something, and then eventually falls out of like a taxidermy bear’s mouth or something, and then into a trash can of the janitor.","Anyway, the janitor empties that out of like a window or something, and I think the rock falls onto the street.","And then there's a guy with flowers looking really distraught who drops the flowers or throws them onto the street, and then picks up the rock and throws the rock through a window.","And in the window there's like a couple having dinner, and so maybe this, that was the love interest of the guy who was very upset in the street.","Anyway, I think the rock hits the male guy of the couple, who’s maybe stealing the distraught guy’s lady, in the head, I think, and then it bounces off the guy’s head and out the other window.","And then it falls down onto the street or, I don’t know, it falls someplace.","Eventually the rock makes its way to a landfill, I think.","And now it’s like really fractured.","And then there's like this crane, oh no, I know.","It doesn’t get to a landfill first.","It’s in like I don’t know, near the shore or a port or something, and there's other rock stuff, and a big crane picks it up, and eventually then it gets made into, I don’t know, it gets dropped off into another truck or something.","So it’s not really a landfill I guess, and anyway, so with a whole other bunch of stuff, sand and rocks and stuff.","And next thing you know, the thing is being processed and made into glass.","And it’s glass that’s being put as the head of like some satellite that gets sent off into outer space.","So now you see shots of NASA and a space rocket going to outer space, ","and now it’s this like satellite that zooms off, and it bounces off some sort of like meteor belt thing, and like the satellite gets damaged, and eventually it crashes on like another planet or the moon or something.","And then like, you know, the rock’s like, kind of, now its glass is kind of broken, but then it, it just like totally plummets into this planet thing.","And I think then swirls happen again, but basically like the planet changes like over time, and basically the rock becomes a mountain again, and there's like a stream or something, so it’s like the circle of rock life.","Alright, that’s the end of the rock thing.","There's still that last skit that I'm totally forgetting.","Let me see if I can remember it.","Oh yeah, I totally remember it, it’s called the Bus Stop.","That thing was so weird; how did I even forget this--it was the weirdest one, it was cool.","So it starts off, and there's this dude who’s like sweating and it’s like a hot day, he's listening to his tunes on his like Sony like headphones.","He's got some double strawberry ice cream in his like plastic bag.","And he just, he's waiting for the bus.","And across the street, this like Ford Explorer sort of SUV car pulls up, and lady gets out of the door, and the car comes to like a sudden stop, so clearly something’s weird.","Lady leaves the door open and goes to like a payphone or something.","She seems already like she’s distraught.","And she like tries the payphone, and it doesn’t work, and while that’s going on, the car just starts rolling a little bit.","And then she like sees the guy, and she walks over to him.","And by the time she gets to him, the car stopped, it didn’t roll that far, but a little bit.","And the guy is just observing this, and the guy is like also just seems like a weirdo, like weird sort of like face, sort of like a Napoleon Dynamite gaze going on, like, and so she asks him for his phone.","And she's like, “I'm not going to steal it,” and he's like, “Okay,” and gives it to her.","And she walks to the other side of the street and calls some guy, and like clearly she's upset at the guy, and she's like, “I'm going to go to the cops, like, you know, where are you? I'm here now. You said you were gonna be here.","Anyway, maybe he hangs up on her or something, because she is pissed, and she slams the phone on the ground.","And the guy is just watching this and like he doesn’t have a huge affective response, although he's clearly kind of like, “What the fuck? My phone just got smashed.”","So he walks over and like picks up the phone, and he's like, “Hey, so like can I get like sixty dollars for my phone so I can get a new one?” and she's like not really paying attention to him.","She's like pretty upset, ","and then the, it cuts to like this guy driving up in sort of an old school, but well kept car, like a Caddy or Chevrolet, sort of boxy car with some, some, I forget if it’s classical or some weird gospel thing music going on on the radio.","And it like pauses there for a little bit, and you can see her staring at him, and he's like staring at the two of them.","And I think it cuts to she's like, “There he is.”","And he's like under some sort of overpass thing, and that’s where the car’s parked, and he hasn’t gotten out of the car yet.","And she's like that's him.","And then I think she starts yelling at him or something and walks towards the car and the guy gets out of the car.","And she's like yelling at him, and he's like, “It’s gonna be okay, you know, just like, you gotta trust me,” or something.","And then she draws a gun on him.","And at that point maybe she's like, “Do you know who this guy is?” or something, and I can't remember if at that point he does the sort of magic act and pulls out the gun at that point,","or if like right before then the sort of slackjawed guy in the headphones, who’s now taken off the headphones and they're just resting on his neck, but you can still hear the music faintly.","And he's like, “Oh yeah you're like the magician guy from, I don’t know, you do the magic,” anyway, and he's like, “Oh yeah, you're his assistant.”","Anyway, at that point or like shortly before, the guy has done the magic with the handkerchief to reveal this very small sort of gun.","It’s like the sort of gun that in the Wild West women would have strapped to their garter belts, or at least that’s how it gets depicted in films.","I don’t know if that was ever real.","Anyway, so he has a little small gun like that, like a one-shot gun or something.","And he starts describing, and she's just like, “Where is she?” or something and like yells at him or something.","But then she like shoots a shot like up in the air, and then you can hear whimpering or something.","And it’s clearly coming from the back trunk of the car.","And she like goes over to that, and while that’s happening, the magician starts talking to like the other dude, who now like, you can look at his face, he's just drenched in sweat.","It’s like a weird element to the short.","Anyway, and while the lady’s trying to get the trunk open, the magician guy is like talking to the, to the, to the other guy, ","and he pulls out another handkerchief, and he's like, “Do you see this?” and like pulls it open, and it’s like this mini coffin, and he opens the coffin.","There's like a skeleton in a fetal position of like a bird or something.","Very tiny, and then the guy starts saying something, like it’s kind of like, gospel like preachery thing, but like kind of like a spell.","And then the like kid guy is like clearly in this weird daze or something.","And then like the guy just like falls over.","And the magician is sort of just like, “Oh,” almost like he’s messed up the spell or something, and then he opens up some paper, like reciting something, almost like he's trying to figure out what he said wrong or something.","So maybe he's trying to put the guy into a spell, but he did the wrong spell, almost like he's not a very good magician.","Anyway, by this time, the lady opens the trunk, and like you don’t see what’s in the trunk, and the lady sort of had this gasp thing like, “Oh my god,” ","and then she walks over to the guy, and the guy’s like, I forget if he says something like, “It’s gonna be okay,” or if she just shoots him outright.","And he falls to the ground, and you see him like take one shot and kills her.","So now they're both dead.","And this guy, this dude and his ice cream that's just everywhere, and that shot of him falling over with the ice cream, and it’s like dripping out of the bag, it was very humorous.","It was weird and humorous.","And so now he's sort of in a fetal position over, but he's not dead.","He sort of leans over and I think at this point you might start hearing barking or something.","And you don’t quite know where it is, but maybe you're starting to think, “Oh that was like a dog” or something that was in the trunk.","Anyway, this guy’s sort of like leans over, the guy who sort of like passed out, and he starts barking.","And he's like acting like a dog and starts licking the ice cream and goes over and sniffs the guy, so you're like all right, so this guy got put under some spell that he thinks he’s a dog.","And then obviously the camera pans over, and sure enough, it’s a woman who is barking like a dog.","So maybe that was the daughter, or you know, some person of meaning to the assistant, who is now shot dead.","So they start barking at each other, and of course they do the gratuitous smell each other’s butts.","And they're barking and barking, and they start walking together, and the guy like leans over and goes on all fours, and they're kind of like aggressively barking, feeling each other out sort of thing.","But eventually they start walk, you know, on all fours walking down the street barking with each other, and then it ends sort of like that.","So that was like a weird film, but it was entertaining.","Okay, I think that’s basically all I remember, so I'm good."],"duration":{"_EnumKey_":[5,13,12,6,7,4,8,3,9,10,14,18,15,11,2,16,17,23],"_EnumValue_":{"_ArraySize_":149,"_ArrayType_":"uint8","_ArrayZipType_":"zlib","_ArrayZipSize_":149,"_ArrayZipData_":"eJwNzYkRwzAMA7CjTVGUUj/t/sM2CwAYkyEhMwODTtlMg9WMsC08lD9BYnFHzbP1ZG7e07eeVV2X\ntLwKgdVLsDh5FhziVzfHPD+KiPSe1X2QpaFZ2C8anfBw8i2zuFP4Ay5sBCQ=\n"}}}}},

first movie that I remember is um the Aviator movie and the beginning there was a game show with three men who claimed they their name is Jack, I forget the name of the character, but three con men.","They, uh, before the age of 19, they were some government official for Georgia, an aviator for a plane, and something to do with a hospital.","And then it goes to a guy named Carl who works with the FBI and he goes to the center, which the guy...maybe Jack...is being held and he tries to talk to Jack through a little tiny hole in the wall that is open.","I think he has some sort of history with Jack, I'm not sure if he was trying to find out information or what.","Jack is being held in a really severe punishment system, ","so Jack pretends to faint, or pretends to get really, really sick and Carl's trying to talk to him and Carl screams for an ambulance or for a doctor so that the other guys come and they bring him to the hospital, ","but then, yeah, all the men put him on the bed and they start washing their hands and Carl said `what are you doing' and the guy said that the doctor is coming the next day and they see that the door to the hospital room just closed, ","so they follow the route and they see that Jack, or whoever the man's name is has left the room, he's not in his bed anymore, and they run after him and they find him crawling on the floor of the prison, ","a bunch of angry and enthusiastic prison men are screaming batting their cages while he's crawling around the floor and then the FBI men walk fastly towards him and one of them puts a gun to Jack's head, ","and Jack goes on the ground and kind of puts his hands and arms out, kind of like he surrenders.","I remember when he's leaving the hospital room, Carl said ","The next movie was the movie about, it was a cartoon movie, I think it was called the Record, and it was a very cute movie.","It was a girl, and when she was a young adult, she had red hair, orange hair, and she started eating a pizza and she put a record on and the record of a girl's voice,","and when she was moving the place in the record in the song, whatever that part of the record player is called, she noticed that the pizza is disappearing, and depending on where the record was in its cycle, the pizza was appearing and disappearing.","And then scene goes to the box of pizza, the entire pizza is disappearing and reappearing.","Then she jumps on the record to different points and the next point that she jumps to is to the time in her life where she's already married because there's a picture frame in the wall of her in a wedding veil and she's pregnant.","She looks down at stomach and she's playing around with the record to see her stomach grow and shrink and then she skips to when she was a baby herself and she has a doll in her hand and a playpen there, ","and then she skips to when she's an older woman, and she keeps getting, there's this weird electric field that keeps happening in the record, and in her chair she keeps getting thrown away, like she can't reach the record to switch her position again.","Then she switches, when she does get to switch her position again she switches to this even older woman using a walker.","And that's all I remember of that one.","These are definitely gonna be out of order.","There was the shoe.","It was really cute, it was a man and a woman.","The man is leaning against some other guy's car, it's not his own car, and in the beginning of the scene it shows a rapper near his feet maybe he just needs something and then he goes up and he's drinking milk, he's looking inside the milk carton.","And then he sees a girl, catches his attention, that's when some Italian looking man comes over and yells at him about leaning on his car.","So then the guy starts walking away, but he's still looking at this girl, and then the girl's being cute and starts imitating what the guy's doing.","So they start, she starts copying moves that he's doing and he goes to put the milk carton on top of the fence and she also raises her hand in the same motion, and then he trips and she trips, ","this happened before the milk carton thing, and then she does this little dance and he does this little dance, they go back and forth for a while but then they get to the end of the sidewalk, ","and she realizes that it's the end of the sidewalk and a car is coming on his end, and he doesn't realize it and he continues to walk into the street, trying to entertain her.","He gets hit by the car, the car flies dramatically, it lands somewhere, and then it goes back to the girl, super surprised and doesn't know how to react, ","and then it goes down to the shoe, that came out of I guess from the guy who got hit by the car whose shoe also came flying towards her.","Then it shows another shoe, it's a black shoe, and maybe that was saying that the same thing has happened to her before or to other people before. I don't really know the significance, but...","Um.. let's see.","The one movie where the guy doesn't know where he is; very well-dressed man, probably takes place in the 50s.","He ends up somewhere that's surrounded by mountains ","and it begins he asks a waitress for the closest phone call is and she gives a little bit of trouble that he finds it and then a million buttons is on it and something like the device he's probably never seen before.","He dials for a cab and an Asian woman pulls up and tells him it's the local cab and he says just take me as far away as you can.","And then she takes him far away, she spoke French to him at first, he didn't understand why and asked and she said that most people speak French so it's kind of safe to do that.","And then later on in the conversation she says something about the place being very metropolitan, I think meaning that a lot of people are attracted there or do live there.","So then she takes him as far as she can go and lets him out and it costs 2 credits on the charge but I don't think he had that so she let him go and she did the whole signal, see you around or see you later.","Then he looks into the window shop and then he walks into the shop and asks the man for a map, and the man says black and white or color and the guy says it doesn't matter.","So the man who works there pulls out, he's wearing an apron, pulls out a black and white map, and the black and white map just has wherever he is, surrounded by mountains.","And everything is very, very generally described.","So he asks for a bigger map and guy takes out the black, the color one, says it's much more expensive, but that map has the same amount of detail.","The man is getting very frustrated because he doesn't know where he is and the man who worked there said they only have local maps so the whole place seems like they're confining people and people can't really leave the area and it ends.","Oh there was a cartoon movie ","and it was about the guy who wanted to get a promotion.","His name was Keith?","And then Keith really liked a girl named Sarah, and the entire film is shown in an office building that had at least separate floors to it.","And I think Sarah worked in the fourth floor.","Anyway the man, he's a green man, he wore a hat and had a suitcase, ","and he always went up to Sarah and gave her a cup of coffee every morning even though she didn't want it because that was part of his plan to someday marry her after he gets his promotion ","and when he walks up to the fourth floor she was bent over, which is funny.","He goes into the elevator and looks at his reflection pretty confidently, and then he goes to be talked to by his boss and realizes that he doesn't get a promotion that he thought he was going to get.","Meanwhile another guy a coworker got the promotion and he also goes up to tell Sarah, a very special lady, that he got the promotion.","And Sarah jumps into his arms and they're hugging for a while, then they're making out, and he goes up the elevator to go to Sarah and see if she wants another cup of coffee, sees them making out, and gets really upset.","Then the guy, when he's done making out with Sarah, goes into the elevator, well he asks Keith if he can hold the elevator for him.","Then they're in the elevator together and Keith says he forced himself to take a big breath, and when they got up a few floors, and the thing opened, and the guy was about to leave, ","Keith said three words that he's never said before, probably go f yourself, and then the guy came back into the elevator, ","they started fighting, and then there's blood on the walls of the elevator, and then Keith accidentally, or not accidentally kills the man.","He doesn't know what to do so he decides to take the body home while he decides what to do.","And then a woman I think her name was Ruth, on the first floor, needed to go up all the way to the 6th or 7th floor, and was gonna take the elevator, but her new year's resolution said that she should walk up the stairs whenever she can.","So she's on her way up the stairs.","Meanwhile Keith is trying to drag the body down the stairs and eventually they run into each other and then the woman, maybe Ruth, faints.","Keith saw her eyes roll to the back of her head, then he continues dragging the body and eventually he's, ","what happens, oh I think Sarah goes up to that same floor to try to see the guy who just got the promotion and she uses some excuse to go up and see him.","She gets up there and she sees Keith dragging his body, and then Keith thinks that maybe she likes a silent man so maybe he won't say anything, ","he doesn't really know what to say and then Sarah faints, so Keith said that maybe dead bodies have that sort of effect on women.","And he takes the body and I think he starts going down a ladder that's outside of the building, ","oh I remember that one of the first things that happened is that when Keith brought coffee up to Sarah, the speaker's making a point that Sarah never drinks his coffee, and she dumps it outside the window and it hit a guy and the guy fell.","And then different people saw the man fall through the window.","Anyway, back to Keith dragging the body down the ladder on the outside of the building.","And then after he got down the ladder he's appalled and sees a man who works there and he's been working there for 8 years, and he's never seen this man before.","And he's pondering life and how any man probably wants the things the he wants, like a good job, a nice wife, yada yada yada.","Then, yeah he had like a very interesting moment there swaying back and forth on the ladder, and it ends.","Another scene that stands out to me is the scene where towards the end of all the movies I've watched, the guy, who's probably young 20's, it's the middle of the day, ","it doesn't seem like he's really doing anything, there's a bag of strawberry something, a box of strawberries something within a bag he's holding, and he has his headphones on.","And there's a woman who pulls up at the car and she gets out to use the payphone while her car, I guess it's in neutral, starts rolling away, and the payphone I guess is not working.","She's wearing like this floral open shirt, she runs over to the guy who's on the curb with headphones and she asks to use his phone.","So she starts using his phone when she's on the phone, ","she's like yelling at whoever she's on the phone with saying that I'm going to turn you into the police, she's really frantic, and she's really upset, has no shoes on, she's in the middle of the street,","and then she gets so angry at the phone call that she throws the phone at the ground, breaks the phone.","So then, the guy goes over to his phone, and was like, miss miss miss, are you going to pay for this?","Like at least 60 dollars and she's completely ignoring him because she's very much in a really dangerous mental place right now I guess.","And then some car pulls up and it's under the bridge and for a while the camera shows the back of the head's man in the car and he's got an earring under his left ear.","And he's wearing, he kind of unzips his suit and tie, I guess he's coming from work, he has a red car.","And anyway, the woman starts walking towards the car and the guy with the headphones is following her, still asking for money for his phone.","And they get up to the car and the guy walks out and him and the woman are having, they're bickering, and the man is asking the woman if the woman told the other guy with the headphones who he is.","And she's saying I'm not sure if she responded to that, but basically she said that he's a friend of hers, so the guy thought that they're somehow related, I'm not really sure, somehow associated.","And then the guy, the woman keeps asking the man in the car where is she where is she and he's not answering her.","And then she pulls out a gun, and then I think she's got red curly hair.","Then he does a magic trick, and the gun comes out.","Oh that happens after the guy was like did you tell him who I am and then the kid was like oh you're the magician from whatever show and then she's your assistant.","So yes, later on when she draws the gun, then he creates it from his magic, they're pointing it at each other and threatening.","He asks if it's loaded and she doesn't answer.","He asks if it's loaded before he pulls out his own gun.","And then at some point she shoots at this guy to indicate that it is loaded.","And anyway the guy walks over to the kid with headphones, and pulls out this really weird box that's wrapped in cloth and the box is like a tiny coffin with a cross on it, and inside is a skeleton, probably of a little frog.","And then the guy starts doing this weird magic trick voodoo thing, starts saying this chant to the kid, and the kid's watching.","And the guy says it wrong, and the kid falls to the ground, the guy says son of a bitch, I guess he said it wrong.","He pulls out the words on it and he's repeating it to himself, trying to see where his mistake was.","Meanwhile the woman is trying to find, she hears the girl that she's been asking for.","She hears the girl moaning or making some noises and then she goes over to the trunk and then she sees, you don't really see the girl in the trunk, but you see the woman's expression and she's really flabbergasted.","And then the woman goes over to the guy and she shoots him.","Then he falls to the ground, and right before he dies, he shoots her back.","Meanwhile the kid with the headphones is on the ground from the spell, he starts barking like a dog, he's acting like a dog, and he's responding to the barks of another dog.","And then the girl appears and she's also acting like a dog and it was the girl that was in the car trunk and so they're barking at each other and sniffing each other and acting like dogs together ","and I guess what happened was that the man probably did a magic trick, he's probably practicing a magic trick on the woman's daughter, or a girl that was special to the woman, ","and the woman got really upset about it, but he made the exact same mistake on the kid with the headphones and it ends there.","Oh there's the robot one where a woman with short hair, dark hair and dark eyes, she's sitting at a long table on the long side across from her boyfriend, it's called the boyfriend.","She, it's pretty quiet between the two of them, and she asks the boyfriend if he wants to drink white wine and he says he doesn't want to drink because he has a big day tomorrow at work, I think he has a client or something the next day.","And the woman's trying to talk to him and she's clearly not driving with him very well, not getting along with him.","I think she's really upset with him.","And when he says that he won't drink, she throws a little bit of a tantrum and says like you're a computer, you should relax.","She throws her drink at him and then after they start fighting.","And that happens after she pours herself two full glasses of wine, and now she chugs the first one, almost rubbing in his face that she's going to drink one for him.","Meanwhile he's looking at his silverware, continuing to eat his food.","Anyways when she throws her wine at his face, he starts lighting his cigarette, so she goes over, she's just furious, she takes the cigarette and goes to the sink and puts the cigarette out, the rule that nobody can smoke in her house.","And as she turns around, he's lighting a second cigarette.","Then she goes over to him, sits on his lap, and with being all cuddly and affectionate and kind of apologetic, and meanwhile, and she's acting like rubbing him all affectionately ","and she goes to the back of his neck and she turns this robotic switch that was on to off, which kills him or shuts down his machinery because he's a robot.","Then she goes online, she has an Apple computer, she looks up at the table and there he is, with his feet and his head fallen down in front of him.","She's on the computer, she's on the robotics.com website and she's just looking for a model that's more upgraded, a model that she'd like better and she calls up the service and the phone number for the service is filled with eights and zeros, ","and she talks to a woman on the phone and the woman says that the models that are in the 100s is like her previous boyfriend, tends to have the problems that the woman was explaining.","The problems that the woman was explaining was that he lacks ambition, and something else I forget.","Anyway the woman on the phone says would you like an upgraded version and the girlfriend says yes and she's looking and she suggests that she gets a rock climber or a masseuse and she goes what about a rock-climbing masseuse?","And then she starts tailoring her ideal boyfriend to the woman on the phone.","She wants shorter hair, more sporty.","So that was the suggestion that the woman on the phone had, if she had any suggestions on what update she wants.","Then she gets a knock on her door,","it's two women, one was blonde with a ponytail, and they're wheeling in the new robot, and the robotics company on the box where the new robot was coming in had some logo or motto on it something like love at first sight or like find true love,","something like that.","And anyway meanwhile, her ex-boyfriend is now being propped up on a cart and taken away, and she goes wait a second.","She goes over to him, gives him a quick kiss on the lips and takes off his wedding ring.","And then she puts the wedding ring on the new robot, and they then she's sitting at dinner with the new robot.","Oh this is her anniversary by the way, and I think that's why she got so upset.","I think she was married to the old robot for a while and it was her anniversary and I guess she's getting increasingly not happy with it.","So then anyways basically she replaced her ex-boyfriend with the new robot, she thinks it's better.","She's, they're at dinner and she turns him on, he takes a few seconds, he blinks, and then they're chit chatting, ","and basically they're having a conversation, you know the same conversation that she had with her ex-boyfriend about the asparagus and she says something about Aphrodite or aphrodisiac, and saying something about that's just what people say.","Those were words from out of her mouth to making to her ex-husband, and that conversation followed the whole conversation that he said that he was not going the have any wine, and then, sorry, I'm not being very straight right now, ","but when the new boyfriend, the girl asks if he wants wine, and he came up with the same response as the ex-boyfriend saying no I have a big day at work tomorrow.","So she gets frustrated for a second ","but then the new boyfriend he said the asparagus is very tender and said something about the aphrodisiac and then the girlfriend smiles because basically he just fulfilled something the ex-boyfriend lacked and I guess he also reminded her of her, making a note that they're a better match.","So then the rock climber masseuse new boyfriend comes over out of his seat to give her a neck massage, and during the neck massage, he asks her how her day was, and then he flips her robotic switch off.","So then the new boyfriend basically shut down his new girlfriend and then yeah he's basically the winner, he goes over to the couch and lights up a cigarette, has a beer in his hand and starts watching sports or something.","So it's a twist in the story.","And, what else is there.","Trying to remember the other ones, I think there were a few more.","Oh the rock one.","So it was a really cute story.","It was about the beginning of time before dinosaurs, and it was an animated movie about a big mountain rock who had eyes and a big round nose.","He's this huge mountain.","He exhales, I think he exhales or something and then time moves forward and then dinosaurs are there.","And his exhaling like, I think it was saying that he moved and the earth kind of shifted, and then evolution was affected by his movement.","And then the dinosaurs are there, and yeah he evolves over time in a few historic events, like Abe Lincoln is chopping down, ","oh okay, before Abe Lincoln, he's a mountain, there are dinosaurs and there's an Ice Age that happens, and he's completely white, and then I think he melts from the ice age and I think he's a little bit smaller of rock.","And then years later there's a tree on top of his head and then Abe Lincoln or Washington or whoever it was, was chopping down the tree, I think it was some historical reference, I'm really bad with history and I'm not thinking about that right now.","But then you see an industrial revolution happen around him and then he is, he goes through all these different stages of his life and each stage he gets smaller and smaller, ","so he goes to a factory and he's used as a wheel, I think with a belt wrapped around it to make something, and these people come in with pitchforks, these officials, and they take him and trying to think about things that he did.","I forget the series of events exactly, but I know at one point he was a rock that was being kicked around by a man who was above in one of the cities that was next to a harbor.","The guy who's kicking, the guy had flowers in one of his hands, and he's kicking the rock, and then he takes the rock and throws it towards, he throws it at the window that I guess that his lover is in, 'cause she was eating with another man.","The rock hits other man.","And then at one point  the rock is in the middle of a street and then a truck is coming, a truck that cleans the street or rolls the street flat, and it rolls him flatter, then he's more of a pebble.","And then I know at one point he's part of the sand and this big crane comes and scoops him up and adds him to a big pile of little pebbles, and then he's dipped, he's made into lava, he's made into fire, he's melted down.","And then he comes up from the other side as glass and he's in a factory, and these men covered in covers and face protectors put a big black box on top of him, ","and then he goes to NASA or some aircraft place and he becomes the glass in front of a spaceship or a satellite.","And he goes off into space and he hits a few objects that are in the atmosphere and then basically gets caught in the orbit of one of the planets that's not Earth, ","and he spins around and around and he gets, he gets thrown onto the surface of the new planet.","And this story comes full cycle because then after a few years, or a few days, or whatever the new time period is on the planet, he becomes part of the planet's earth again.","I guess the planet evolved over some time, and he's a mountain in a valley with a different atmosphere.","So he just by becoming part of the orbit and then hitting the ground he became part of that earth so now the story begins again.","Um the next one.","I can't remember anything else right now.","I'm still thinking."],"duration":{"_EnumKey_":[21,16,17,4,6,18,19,9,15,10,14,7,12,5,2,8,13,11,3,24,22,1],"_EnumValue_":{"_ArraySize_":175,"_ArrayType_":"uint8","_ArrayZipType_":"zlib","_ArrayZipSize_":175,"_ArrayZipData_":"eJwNyVkOwyAMBUCFGIKfd9z2/kdt/kaaa9w017qfzZBLH1vwCB+ZBTsbrV3nQPgQFnlwzFJJzsrU\nEYDB8g0clV1oTH2JJekkoKYFpNqkY6JDdsA3iQ8zFmenHVckHZpzL97xMY7uCIuJYnm+ZT1GmZ0b\n2fH7A4RMB5s=\n"}}}}},

wait do I start talking now?","Okay.","Um, so let's see.","The first skit, uh, the first story, was called Catch Me If You Can, and it opens on the stage of a game show that looks like it's set in the 1970s.","And I think the show was called So you tell a lie?","And it's um shown on this kind of like billboard logo kind of Las Vegas style.","And it starts with a voiceover, a host is saying something about how um we're going to bring on stage one of the greatest impersonators through history.","And um that this guy had flown for, wait so before that, these three guys in airline pilot suits come out and they each introduce themselves as Frank something, I think it's Frank Anglesall.","And um the camera pans from each one to another as the voiceover says um this guy had impersonated a pilot for PanAm and flown like 300 miles or like 3000 miles for free.","And he did this at the same time as pretending to be a doctor at some like at like Mass General Hospital, um and that he had done all of this before the age of 19.","Oh before he says that he did this before the age of 19, he says he also stole like several million dollars and forged bills and checks.","And so then it goes to this old lady who asks some questions.","And she asks number one, um, the first impersonator number one, like, uh why did you do this `cause you're so smart, how did obviously, why did you put all this effort into impersonating people when you could just actually do something and become a doctor for real?","And the first pilot guy says that it was really a um, a calculated thing, which was that it was just uh dollars and cents, he used that phrase, and he thought that it was just the way he could make the most money with the least effort.","And then the lady asks the second impersonator who is acted by Leonardo di Caprio and she asked him, how did you get caught?","And he says he got caught by a um, this detective, I forget his name, Carl, I think.","And as he's, at the moment he says that, it flashes back to this um guy Carl who's this big old guy wearing a hat and a big trenchcoat.","And he's talking to a bunch of French police officers who were carrying umbrellas and he was telling them that he's like the American detective or the American police officer.","And he demands to see Frank the prisoner.","Um and eventually they take him down this into this like nasty prison, in uh Marseilles, I think on the screen it says Marseilles, 1947 or something like that.","And so then he arrives at this prison door and um the prison guard tells him uh you won't open this door, don't open this door, and he opens this little slot and he says, don't pass him anything through here.","You can sit here and talk to him but don't pass him anything through this grill.","So then he sits down and he looks inside through this grill, it looks like a shot of like this cell looking out at him and he tells the prisoner that he's been sent there by the U.S. Consulate or something to read him his rights under like extradition treaty.","He starts on Article 1, it's really boring, I don't remember what he says, but the prisoner inside, Frank, is coughing really hard and he's like wrapped up in these blankets and he's really dirty and has lots of like really long hair and like...and stuff.","And he's coughing and coughing and coughing and he says help me, help me, and um the police officer is like no don't do this to me, you know I can't, or whatever.","So then he says like stay with me, he starts with Article 2 and then the prisoner um starts coughing and then he collapses and it looks like he's dead or like in a coma.","And so the police officer gets really worried and he stands up and starts shouting, like Frank! Frank!","And then like shouts to the police officers that he needs a doctor, he needs a doctor.","And so they come and take him out and they bring him to the medical bay and um they wrestle him onto the bed where he looks like he's dying.","He's coughing and the police officer's like listen to me Frank, I'm gonna get you out of here, tomorrow we're going home, tomorrow we're going home, ","and then the chief of the prison and the guards are then washing their hands and he's like what's he doing, and the police officers said they're washing their hands so we don't get lice "," and uh the police officer says he needs to see a doctor if he's coming back to America tomorrow, and the guy says um, the person says listen, um, the doctor's not coming until tomorrow, ","and so the police officer says ah this guy is coming back to America and he needs to see a doctor, if he dies it's on your head.","And then the prison ward then turns around, and the door is swinging, and they open the curtains, surrounding the bed, and it's empty.","And then it flashes to this long hallway in the prison full of cells, it's two stories and all the prisoners are shouting um because the prisoner Frank is running down it trying to escape.","But then he collapses and he just has to crawl.","And as he's crawling away, you can see the ward and the prison guards and the policeman going after him.","And eventually the ward catches up with him and he pulls out a gun, and he sticks it against Frank's head.","And so Frank like sits back on his knee and he raises his hands and says okay Carl, the police officer, take me home.","And then he collapses backwards on his back like spreadeagle and then the clip ends.","So then the next movie was called like the Single Life I think?","And it's a cartoon and there's this woman with like bright orange hair who's sitting on an armchair at a fuzzy old house.","Um and a package arrives at the door, so she goes and gets it, she opens it up and it's a record and the record is called um the single life.","And so she puts it into her record player and she sits down with a slice of pizza.","But then as it's playing, slowly the slice of pizza is like...it all disappears except for the crust.","And she's really confused and then she looks down at the record and spins it backwards.","The pizza reappears.","She scoots it forward, the pizza disappears again.","She does it several times and then she fast-forwards way ahead, or like a bit more.","And the pizza disappears and the red candle sitting on her bedside like burns all the way down.","And then she goes back and forth between that a couple times.","And then she's like uh she spins it really far, a lot, and then she's in a new house and it looks like kind of an upscale house.","And she's wearing like a fancy black dress and it looks like really well to-do, and she looks down at herself and it turns out she's pregnant.","And she's like really happy and there's a picture of her like getting married on the mantelpiece.","So then she gets a like, she has an expression on her face like she suddenly gets an idea, and she spins the record a whole bunch, like around around around really fast, and then suddenly she's not pregnant anymore, and there's a kid.","Um and then I don't remember exactly what happens to the kid, like the kid is annoyed with something, and so she spins the record way further and then uh suddenly she's old and in a wheelchair.","And um she tries to spin it forward but I guess her hands are shaking, so as she wheels forward and tries to spin it, it keeps resetting her to the beginning where she is just sitting there, so that happens over and over and over, ","until she gets a really determined look on her face, and she spins it, ","and then suddenly she's like an old lady and she's no longer in a wheelchair, but she has a walker.","And she's kind of confused about this and so she goes forward to the record player to move it again, but as she walks forward, she trips and falls.","And then um while she's lying on the ground, the record ends and um she dies and becomes a um ashes and then the needle on the record gets set on the side of the record player and it ends.","And that's the end of that one.","Um let's see.","And then I think the next one is another one that's like called the shoe or something like that.","And it starts with this guy, it starts with a shot of these worn-out shoes, and then it pans up to this uh milk carton, um, and he opens it like first opens it, and there's something like buying this milk and then he opens it and drinks it.","I kind of think this might be an ad for milk but I'm not sure.","And he's drinking it and he's leaning against a car and then the owner of the car comes out and he shouts at him so he um gets off the car and he's walking away, and he trips on like an uneven path of the sidewalk.","And then, as he trips, he sees a woman across the street also trip, it looks like she's tripping at nothing.","And so he's sipping his milk and like looking at her, and then uh let's see, he puts the milk up on the edge of a fence.","And the woman across the street, even though she doesn't have any milk also reaches up, and can see it.","Oh no so this was called like the Copy Cat.","Um and so then he starts walking like exaggeratingly funny, like swinging arms and bent over, and she copies him and then she disappears behind like a mailbox and she's now like really bent over, crazy, walking crazy.","He imitates her.","And they're imitating back and forth, and um, he's reaching the end of the street um towards the crosswalk but he's turned looking at her across the street.","And she tries to signal to him, stop, stop, stop, there's a car coming, don't enter the street and she's like waving her arms, but he doesn't understand and he's just copying her and he keeps walking forward.","And then he gets hit by a car.","And presumably he dies.","And um one of the shoes like flies off, it lands in the gutter.","And then the screen pans forward, we see another shoe, except it's like covered in bees or something.   ","Um, let's see.","Uhh this is out of order now, but um, there was one that was called, something about like Ryan Reinharts and he's a cartoon and he's this really tall, blue stick figure with a hat on it ","and he enters this office building and there's a voiceover describing everything and said that this is a really, really important day for Ryan Reinholtz because he's been there for 8 days ","and this is the day that he's going to become a, uh, he's going to be promoted, because he's the most senior junior businessman.","Um so he enters the elevator, he goes up a floor to see this lady named Sarah that he has a crush on.","And he's imagining like this future with him with this special woman, who is a pink stick figure and what he does so like flirt with her but not very well, he just makes her a cup of coffee.","So he makes her a cup of coffee and gives it to her and he leaves to the elevator, but Sarah doesn't actually like coffee, and so she pours it out the window.","On the window there's a guy on a ladder, um who's like maybe washing windows or something, and so she dumps the hot coffee on him and he falls down.","And he falls down past this window of this HR guy.","And this HR guy is like what?","There's something or someone who fell down outside the window, and so he goes out to check, and he looks down and he figures out it was a someone who fell down, and so then he calls 911.","And then um meanwhile Ryan Reynolds is going up to the uh 7th floor and he's imagining what it's like to get his promotion, and like how there'll be this really firm handshake, and they'll give him this gold... ","pen to sign his name, to make him partner, and he'll look happy and everything.","Um and in the meantime um this other guy is coming down, um to see Sarah, um, to give her some good news he's got today and meanwhile back in the 7th floor with the bosses, ","the handshake is a little less firm than he expected, and there's no gold pen, then he gets told by the um two senior guys that someone else was promoted and he wouldn't be promoted.","And so meanwhile the other guy I think his name is Carl, is telling Sarah that he's been promoted, and they're like hugging and kissing and he's really excited that she's really happy for him, ","and you know Ryan's all like oh I'm sad, so he goes down the elevator, and he thinks oh maybe Sarah wants another cup of coffee.","But then when the elevator doors open, he sees um Carl and Sarah kissing, kissing with open mouths, and Ryan is like oh no, this elevator door seems to be open for a really long time, it's awkward.","And then Carl says oh can you hold the elevator for me, oh!","And he enters the elevator.","But before that actually, while Ryan is watching Carl and Sarah make out, he's picturing in his head what he'd like to do to Carl if he were in a small enclosed room with him.","So then conveniently Carl's in the elevator with him and Ryan gets upset and he says a three letter phrase to him, that he's never said before to anyone, ","and then he immediately regrets doing that because um Carl punches him in the face, and then Ryan overreacts, and he starts like beating him, and then Ryan's on the floor, on the ground, ","and he takes, Carl takes the briefcase, I'm sorry, Ryan takes the briefcase, and he smashes his head open.","And then Ryan's like, oh no I've killed him, what should I do?","And so he uh drags the body out of the elevator, oh no sorry, he's sitting in the elevator and then way back down on the first floor, the receptionist says I need to use the bathroom.","And her favorite bathroom is up on like the 7th or 8th floor and she likes it the best because it has a slightly fancier hand soap dispenser.","And so it sounds like she's going to go up to the elevator, but then she's like because of my new year's resolution, um, the elevator, she decides the stairs.","And so that sounds like it's really good news, for Ryan who's still got Carl in the elevator, but Ryan has just decided to hide Carl's body at his house while he decides what to do with it, ","but he's going to take the stairs so that if the elevator ever opens on the floor, he won't just be seen there, um caught red-handed, because people don't like murderers.","And so he um is walking down the stairs dragging this body, and as they approach the 6th floor, the receptionist lady is there, and she sees Ryan dragging the body, and he's covered in blood.","Oh! That reminds me. So while Ryan is killing Carl, um, he's thinking, I wonder if I wash this shirt soon enough, if I could get the bloodstains out.","So anyways, he's on the stairs, covered in blood.","The receptionist sees him, and she's like freaked out, and she faints.","And she's on the stairs so she falls backwards on her head, and she dies.","Um the narrator says um oh well that was a real accident.","And Ryan says like that's unfortunate, he thinks that's unfortunate, but it wasn't really his fault and so he carries Carl's body past her, being careful not to get any of his footprints into the um blood puddle on the ground.","And meanwhile, Sarah, the lady on the 4th floor, feels like it's been hours since she's seen her lover, and so she decides to take some files up to the 7th floor to do some paperwork with the guy.","His name I think is Carl, but I'm not sure.","Um and as she's leaving, uh, Ryan comes in dragging the body, and she sees her lover covered in, uh, she sees him covered in blood and she faints um, but thankfully she's not on the staircase so she doesn't die, she just faints.","And meanwhile Ryan is thinking, dead bodies, this must be what happens to women, and he has this whole fantasy about how she will um like love him again.","And so at this point Ryan decides to take the body down the uh conveniently placed ladder outside the window that we can just never sneak past the security on the first floor, ","and it flashes down to the first floor, and we see the security guys basically screwing around and watching TV and not really doing anything.","Um and so he uh heaves the body out to the uh, to the ladder, and of course he drops it, and the ladder is teetering, it's no longer propped up against the window, ","and Ryan is balancing on the top of it, and he sees into one of the floors, where he sees a janitor who's mopping the floors.","And he suddenly realizes that a lot of people are probably trying to the get the same things that he's trying to do, like the same type of happiness, which is like a better job, a promotion, and a beautiful wife, ","and he's considering this as he's looking at the janitor, in one of the really weird moments, and he's just balancing on top of the stair, ","and I don't remember exactly what happens next, I think he just goes down the ladder and it ends. ","um, okay.","So then there was another clip called The Black Hole, which also occurred in a um office, but it was live action.","It starts with this kind of like schleppy white guy who's just like looking really bored in front of a copier machine, he's making copies, majorly bored and the office is totally empty.","And the um copier suddenly jams, especially the copy button, he doesn't know what's happening, and so then he like looks around and he takes the um he takes the copier machine and starts looking at it, it starts working again.","And it prints out like this large piece of paper like larger than an 8 and a half by 11, um, which just has this giant, black circle on it.","He looks at it and he looks inside the printer, or I mean the copier, and there's nothing there, except like a splash of ... which flashes of his face.","He's like kind of confused and he just places the large sheet of paper with the black hole, the black circle, next to the printer, and he's drinking some water, and he puts down the cup on the piece of paper, but it disappears and he's like whoa.","And so then he looks a little closer at it, and he bends down and like looks at it carefully, ","and he reaches close so he sticks his hand next to it and he goes like a rraow sound so he pulls it back really fast and then he approaches again, he sticks his hand all the way into it, he pulls out his um plastic cup.","So he picks it up, he's looking at it, and he's looking around, and he decides to go to the vending machine and he takes the black hole or the black circle to the front of the vending machine, ","and he sticks his arm in, um and he pulls it back out with some candy, a chocolate bar.","So then he's like eating this chocolate bar, looking at this piece of paper and he sees this door that says something like ","and so he sticks the paper on the door, and he sticks his hand through it and around the door and unlocks it from the inside and then he opens the door.","Inside this office is a safe and so he tapes the piece of paper to the safe and he's looking around cautiously to make sure people aren't there, which he also stupidly doesn't shut the door so people can't see him, so the door is wide open.","Um and he sticks his hand through and he pulls out this giant wad of bills that has like one of those little like rag key things around it.","He's really excited, he reaches back in to grab more, and more and more, pretty soon he has a big pile.","And he's reaching further and further into the safe, to get the last uh stacks of money.","And pretty soon he sticks his head in, and as you probably could have guessed from the beginning, um, basically he reaches all the way in, and he climbs into the safe, ","and then the piece of paper falls down because the tape wasn't good, and then it falls down onto the floor, and then he's trapped inside the safe, and he's banging on it, ","and then the uh screen pans out to the safe, he's banging on it, and then it ends.","Um, okay.","And then another clip was called like the Boyfriends and then it flipped to a screen that said High maintenance.","And it opens on this um pretty fancy dining room and there's a long table with a white tablecloth, and three candles on it.","And at one end, there's this woman, this white woman with short, dark hair, and at the other end is this white guy with dark hair.","And they're eating dinner in silence, and it's kind of awkward.","Um it seems sort of stilted.","And the woman asks him, uh, would you like some wine?","Um he says no, or no no no sorry, she gets up to pour wine into his glass, but he covers it with his glass and he says ","and the woman kind of like rolls her eyes and she goes back to her seat and pours herself a giant glass of wine and then drinks the entire thing in one gulp and then refills it.","And then the man, he uh, what happens next. Uh..","the guy says something like ","And the woman's like, oh you know just some people, you know, like people.","Um, and then it's really awkward and she suddenly, something happens, which I can't quite remember, and then she suddenly says like ","And um, uhh, ","something happens and she throws the glass of water, the glass of wine, into his face.","Um and she starts shouting about how it's her anniversary and this isn't how she imagined her anniversary, silently eating dinner, and some awkward conversation, and then if she's lucky, followed by some really mechanical sex, um which she hates.","And then the guy sits up, and he's covered in wine, and he takes out a cigarette and starts smoking, and she says like ","and she takes it and then stubs it out in an ashtray on the other side of the table, but he just takes out another cigarette.","Um, and then I'm not sure what happens, but she eventually approaches him, and she's like, ","It sounded really sarcastic, but then she's sitting on his lap and she's like caressing him and being like ","and her hand reaches behind his head, so like his head lowers down his collar, where there's like this little like switch thing.","And she switches it off and then the guy basically powers down, and it turns out he's a robot.","And then she's just sitting there sighing.","She goes back to the other side of the table, takes off her shoes, and sticks her feet on the table.","Um so then she's on her laptop on her bed, and she's looking at the website of the manufacturer who makes these like companion robots, these love robots, ","and I forgot what it was called, it had a clever name, it's like love something or the other and the logo is like this red heart on a white background.","She's looking through different profiles, and she eventually comes across one that's called Paul, which is this like rugged uh like dangerous type guy with like kind of long, shaggy hair.","Um and she's looking at this guy and comparing it to her like shut-off robot which is really like staid and boring.","So she takes up this Bluetooth uh phone, she sticks it in her ear and she calls the company, and they ask like what can I do for you?","And she says, um, she sounds kind of nervous, and she says like, ","and then they ask what her complaint is, and she says that he has no ambition, no spontaneity, ","and the customer service person just says oh that's a really common complaint about the 100 model, would it help if we upgraded you to a superior model?","And she says yes and the person on the phone says okay, well did you have one in mind?","Um and she reads out the like serial number of Paul, the rugged guy, and she's looking around pictures, and she's like oh, if he could be a rockclimber, ","and she clicks again and it's a guy massaging a woman, and she's like oh no a masseuse, a massage companion, a massage robot.","And then the camera pans around so it's now facing her instead of the screen,","and it's like her on the edge of the bathroom and it's like her, it's her in a bedroom on a laptop and she's no longer nervous, she's excited, she's like, oh wait! How about a rock climber masseuse?","And then she's talking about specification, she's like well, could the hair be shorter?","And I like blonde and no facial hair?","Well maybe just like a 5 o'clock shadow, uh so basically she's designing her perfect boyfriend.","Um, and then, uhh, let's see.","There's also, so while she's ordering this, she looks at the robot, and then looks at this picture of her in like a wedding dress when she's like married but then she just keeps ordering.","And then um there's a ring at the door, uh, the doorbell rings at her door, she opens it, ","and there's this tall beautiful blonde woman with a giant box, wooden box, and there's another identical woman there also, and they bring um the guy, the box in, and they open it up ","and there's a guy, he's like plastic wrapped, and it's this blonde rugged guy with a 5 o'clock shadow.","And they unpack him, put him on the couch.","And then they take the old, boring guy, ","oh, right, I forgot this part. Earlier, she gets mad at him, and she's like you're just a computer system analyst, not a surgeon!","You don't need to not drink when you're on call.","Um so anyways they take this guy and they um put him on a dolly and he's strapped down, and then they're wheeling him away, and the lady suddenly looks kind of sad, and she's like wait!","And she runs up to him on the dolly, and she kisses him, and then she takes away his wedding ring.","She lets them take it away.","And then she puts the wedding ring on the new guy.","Oh and the new guy actually at the dinner table, not on the couch.","And she switches him on, sits down at the other end of the table, and it's just like the dinner from the night before.","With the candles, the tablecloth, and everything.","And the guy robot actually comes alive, um, and he starts eating, and the woman asks, offers wine, she says, oh would you like some wine?","And he says no, I can't drink, I have a climb tomorrow.","And she's really disappointed, she's like oh no, it's the whole same thing again, especially because the next thing he says is the asparagus is really tender, and he says, and she's like oh, she's like really resigned, oh is it, blah blah blah, ","and the guy says um oh you know some people say that asparagus is an aphrodisiac and she perks up and she says kind of like flirtingly kind of like flirting, who says that, and he says oh, just people.","He puts like his napkin down, and he walks around to the other side of the table, who starts massaging the table, sorry, her elbow, her shoulders, he asks like, how was your day, dear.","And she's not very interesting either.","She talks just about how like she went to town, she went shopping, and then uh went to dinner, or lunch with Anna, and that it's her anniversary, she decided to treat herself, ","and then um, as the guy's massaging her, he approaches her neck and it turns out there's a switch on her neck also, so she's actually a robot too!","And he switches her off, which she just slumps over, and he grabs like a bottle of beer, and turns on sports on the TV and sits down and is drinking beer, and that's the end of it.","Um, okay.","And then there was another clip that was called like the Prisoner.","It was like an old clip, I think it was made from the Twilight Zone.","And um there's this tall, white guy, and um, he's like in this kind of picturesque village and um he's talking to this woman, and she's like you're new to this area, aren't you?","And he's like, yes, and can I find a phone?","Uh, can I borrow your phone and she's like I don't have a phone.","Um the nearest phone is around the corner.","And so he goes around the corner and there's this phone, but it's not like a normal public phone, it's like a cellphone, I think?","And it's like what the 1970s thought what a cellphone is, like this long, L-shaped piece."],"duration":{"_EnumKey_":[3,2,4,12,7,10,13,21,20,14,5,22,17,16,19,15,11,6,9,8,18],"_EnumValue_":{"_ArraySize_":221,"_ArrayType_":"uint8","_ArrayZipType_":"zlib","_ArrayZipSize_":221,"_ArrayZipData_":"eJwNjFESAyEIxQZB7EpV3sPe/6rdz2QykabWfXye6fFdw8fQueMkjOqVPL6VrAgDySbs4lfzl3Fx\nWuAreT10iaFJ73Jgtd+JjKfvhZsUVPZY5rA9VEPOko/Nmm5+W+EUFte4aKtYZiU+oRJAPUxyZy8H\nW8fr8QIHOKkMu7+rCkk2jS6mmVPfJiKmRFT/A+/qCVs=\n"}}},"sub-10_task-recall_run-02_bold.nii.gz":{"_DataLink_":"https://neurojson.org/io/stat.cgi?action=get&db=openneuro&doc=ds004042&file=sub-10/func/sub-10_task-recall_run-02_bold.nii.gz&size=539510422"},"sub-10_task-recall_run-02_events.tsv":{"onset":[9.6,21.6,25.6,35.6,44.6,47.6,64.6,72.6,74.6,78.6,89.6,91.6,94.6,98.6,104.6,113.6,117.6,119.6,125.6,138.6,147.6,151.6,153.6,156.6,160.6,167.6,170.6,173.6,178.6,195.6,211.6,217.6,231.6,237.6,240.6,244.6,257.6,260.6,263.6,265.6,279.6,286.6,293.6,298.6,312.6,315.6,320.6,326.6,328.6,334.6,352.6,357.6,362.6,380.6,396.6,398.6,403.6,421.6,428.6,429.6,439.6,445.6,454.6,455.6,460.6,464.6,467.6,473.6,477.6,483.6,491.6,504.6,512.6,529.6,531.6,533.6,538.6,550.6,558.6,572.6,580.6,595.6,600.6,608.6,616.6,618.6,633.6,636.6,644.6,652.6,658.6,662.6,665.6,672.6,676.6,684.6,692.6,695.6,711.6,720.6,728.6,746.6,750.6,757.6,759.6,774.6,776.6,779.6,792.6,796.6,805.6,815.6,827.6,839.6,852.6,864.6,875.6,882.6,890.6,898.6,902.6,907.6,912.6,916.6,923.6,933.6,942.6,955.6,962.6,972.6,979.6,997.6,1008.6,1015.6,1016.6,1029.6,1048.6,1056.6,1063.6,1067.6,1072.6,1072.6,1084.6,1099.6,1121.6,1136.6,1147.6,1162.6,1182.6,1202.6,1215.6,1219.6,1227.6,1229.6,1236.6],"recall_transcript":["Okay, um so the guy is talking on his cellphone, which is like this L-shaped piece of paper, L-shaped piece of plastic, and the operator is asking, what's your number?","And he starts talking and the woman keeps going on like no, what's your number?","So eventually he says, I don't have a number and the operator says if you don't have a number, then you can't make a call and so um shuts it off and stops so there's a dial tone.","So he puts the phone down and then he wanders off and he finds this like display board, um with a bunch of buttons.","And he's looking at it and eventually pushes this button, ","and all of a sudden right behind him, there's this woman, an Asian woman, with like really heavy eyeliner, um, driving a car, and she says, uh local taxi service, and then she said something in French and then he gets in.","And he's like can you take me to the nearest uh town or something?","And she says, local service only.","And so he says just take me as far as you can go.","And then they're driving along a sort of awkwardly quaint and perfect town, and he says to her, why did you speak to me in French?","And she says well I thought you might be French.","Well actually I thought you might be Polish or Czech.","And he says why would you think I'm Polish or Czech?","And he's like driving along, and she says well it's a very cosmopolitan town, you never know what sorts you will find.","And so eventually they don't go very far and they stop, and he gets down, she looks at him and she's like, she's like, I did tell you, this is a local service.","And he's on the sidewalk and she says that'll be 2 units and he's like, 2 what?","Two units.","And it's obvious he doesn't have any money so she says well, just pay me next time, and drives off.","Um so then he sees a store, a general store, and so he goes into it, and there's this shopkeeper, and a customer, and they're talking very loudly in a foreign language.","And then they suddenly switch to English, and the man approaches the shopkeeper, and he's like, can I have a map of the local area?","And the shopkeeper asks if he wants a small one, black and white, or color.","And the man says I don't care.","And so the guy goes and finds a map, and gives it to him.","And it's a map of the local area and it doesn't have any details at all.","Like there's like a town square, and it flashes all around, the camera flashes all around it, and like it says, mountains.","And so it says mountains mountains mountains all the way around.","And he's like, uh, can I have a bigger map?","And the shopkeeper says it's in color, it costs more, it's more expensive, and he says that's fine.","And so he pulls out another map, and the man unfolds it, and he sees, it's the exact same thing, but larger and in color, and the area's just surrounded with like mountain and there's like square and shop um it's like a really simplistic map.","And he says to the shopkeeper, no you don't understand, I want a map of a larger area, like a map that covers a larger area, and the man says like oh we don't have that, no one asked after that ever, and the man is like, what?","And he's confused, and then the shopkeeper says uh you're new around here, aren't you?","And the man is confused, and, let's see, they're in the shop, I don't remember what happens next, I think it ends early after that.","Yeah he leaves the shop and he's looking around, and then it just ends.","Um, okay.","And then there was another video that was called like Post-it love?","Um and it starts with this uh man and woman in an office building, and they're doing something, kind of like sneaking looks at each other.","And then maybe they're getting water.","And then the man goes back to his cubicle, where he asks, ","oh! No no no I remember what they're doing!","Um, they're in adjacent cubicles, making copies, and they're making copies like perfectly in sync, and then the copy machine then stops working, and so they have to repair it with paper, and they're refilling it in synchrony.","And then they stand up and they're both making copies, and then they turn to face each other, and see that they're doing the exact same thing, and they look away.","And then it follows the man going back to his cubicle, and on the cubicle, on his desk, he sees this blue folder.","And when he opens it up, there's a smiley face made out of yellow Post-it notes.","He's looking at this and he smiles, and kind of backs up in his wheely chair, he's looking around to see who made it, and as he's looking around, the woman from earlier leans out from her cubicle, looks at him, then turns back in.","He's like aha, and certainly he's happy.","So then he sees the smiley face, ","uh..","he also reciprocates.","Uh the, let's see, so, um, she's in the bathroom and she's like washing her hands, ","and then someone enters, no wait, he's washing his hands, and this guy enters, one of the, one of the stalls and he shuts it and there's a Post-it drawing on it, of a thought bubble with a heart in it, and it lines up perfectly with his head.","And so then, uhh, ","so she gets and he gets something for her before this but I don't remember what it was.","So then it goes to the girl, and she's entering a um, entering this supply closet and she turns on the light and there's a flower made out of Post-it notes, like a pink flower, and her hand is perfectly positioned as if she's holding it, ","and then she um runs around and she grabs all these Post-it notes and she has like this armload of Post-it notes and when she leaves she shoves the door, and right next to the door on the side it says something like ","She obviously isn't doing it.","So then she's walking down the hall, with her arms wrapped, carrying all of these Post-it notes, ","and she suddenly stops, suddenly, because she sees on this big wall, there's this big wall, and the guy has created this massive mural out of Post-it notes and the two of them, a pair of faces standing next to each other.","And he's carefully placing these purple Post-it notes to make her hairclip, and he's standing there and turns around, and sees her, ","and she looks at him, ","and actually I thought this was kind of creepy, you see this girl down the corner and this guy you've never heard before, anyways, this guy you've never talked to before is making a giant mural of your face.","But she likes it and she smiles, and uh that's that.","And I'm trying to remember the first Post-it that he made for her.","Let's see,","she makes the smiley face.","He does something, and then there's the thought bubble.","Yes, she makes the thought bubble for him, and then he makes the flower for her.","And then he makes the face and there's something else she does for him but I don't remember what it was.","Um, let's see.","Are there any other videos?","Oh! Yeah, okay, there was this um weird one where it was called the Bus Stop.","and there's this guy with big over the ear white headphones, he's listening to music and he's waiting at a bus stop when this SUV comes off the highway, stops suddenly,","and the door is still open, and this woman, like this harried woman rushes out, and she's talking on the public telephone.","Uhh or something but it doesn't work and then she starts approaching him, he's still looking at her, and he's like this really pasty sweaty white guy, really pale, and as she's stomping towards him, the um her car is slowly rolling backwards.","And then she asks him, can I use your phone?","I won't steal it, I promise.","And so he gives her his phone and she walks away.","And she's wearing this really ugly like flowery jacket and matching pants and she walks away and she dials and then she's swearing at this guy and she's like, what are you doing?","And um she gets really angry and then she throws the phone on the ground and it breaks, and the guy is like what?","And he goes over to the phone, he picks it up, and he's kneeling on the ground looking at his phone, and the woman's just standing there like crying, and he says, lady this phone is broken, could I have like 60 bucks to replace it?","And she's really upset and isn't responding, and he's like, could you replace it, I just need some money, like you broke my phone.","And then it flashes to this guy in another car and he has an earring on one ear, he's driving this old car and starting to approach, and then the guy with the headphones is like, wait, lady are you okay, miss, he calls her miss, are you okay miss?","And they turn around and see this car, and he asks her, who's that miss?","And then she starts running towards him, and there's this guy in the car with the earring who comes out and she starts swearing at him, ","she says fuck you and then the guy is saying, she'll be just fine, and it's all right, you should calm down, she'll be just fine, you'll see.","She's like where is she where is she?","And he says, it's okay, and she calls him a cock, which is awesome, and then um, the other guy whose phone was broken is approaching them and the old guy with the earring's like who's this guy?","And the woman says oh it's just a friend.","And she runs off and then the guy with the earring is like, uh, you're just a friend?","And he's really aggressive and then the guy says no no no no no, I was just waiting at the bus stop, she asked to borrow my phone, and then she broke it, ","and I just want to get money for it, just like can I just get some money for the phone that she broke to replace it?","And then he's like, the guy with the earring, is like, did you tell him who I am?","He's asking like did you tell him who I am?","And the guy suddenly, the guy with the phone, suddenly realizes and says, hey, you're that magician who works at the casino.","He points at the woman and you're his assistant.","And um the woman rushes at him, and like they try to keep him separate and the guy the guy with his phone just leaves.","And the woman's heading towards the car, and she's like trying to force the trunk of the car open because there's like banging inside it.","And then the magician runs off towards the guy with the phone, ","he's like wait wait wait I have something to show you, and he unlocks this coffin in his handkerchief and inside the coffin is like this little mummy, and he starts mumbling this weird incantation and he's hypnotizing the guy with the phone, ","and meanwhile the woman is forcing open the trunk and she eventually opens it, and she sees what's inside, she steps back and covers her mouth.","And um the magician meanwhile is finishing hypnotizing the guy with the phone who eventually collapses on the floor, on the ground, ","and his shopping bag falls open, and this like white liquid is falling out, and I thought he was dead, but then it turns it uh pans back to the screen, and he's just lying on the ground, and it turns out the white liquid was ice cream from this little carton, ","and the magician he's looking at it and he's like oh crap!","And he takes out this little notebook and he's like mumbling things, I think he's trying to figure out the incantation.","And then, oh I forgot about this part!","Um so earlier, um when the guy on the phone is like aha you're the guy who's the magician, and you're his assistant, the woman who's the assistant pulls out her uh, pulls out a gun, and points it at the magician.","The magician's like oh is that loaded?","Well guess what, he does a little magic trick, and he pulls out his gun.","And he says, I also have this gun, and this gun's from, it's a famous gun, and he's doing his little magician pattern, the woman gets angry and she takes the gun and fires it into the air.","And that's the point when the guy on the phone leaves the scene.","But anyway, so he's on the ground, and there's spilled ice cream next to him, and the woman stalks back over and she's really angry because of what she found in the trunk.","And then she shoots him and then the guy shoots her, so then they're both on the ground, dead, with this guy lying on the ground twitching next to the ice cream.","And then he like gets on all fours, and he starts licking the ice cream on the floor and the white headphones are hanging around his neck with a cord trailing kind of like a leash.","And then he starts barking and there's something, a dog, offscreen barking, and so this guy's crawling, he's barking, and kind of aggressively at this other dog approaches.","And it turns out this other dog is this woman who's also apparently been hypnotized, and was probably in the trunk and so they're barking at each other and they're circling each other, um like sniffing each other's butts,","and then they start walking off together, so the guy rolls on his stomach, and the other, the lady dog, lady, who's hypnotized to be a dog, is like sniffing at him and then they walk off.","Uh and that's the end of that scene.","Oh yeah okay! And then the last clip I think, not the last clip I saw, but the last clip I could remember, was called like The Mountain.","And it's a cartoon and it starts with like this mountain with a big nose and eyes and it's just like sleeping on the earth ","um and there's like all this weather happening and then there's this Ice Age and it sweeps him off the edge and now he's a big boulder.","And he rolls along the ground.","Um and he's just lying in the ground and like vegetation grows ","and then um let's see.","He's asleep but then he wakes up because he's annoyed, oh no no no!","He opens his eyes and he sees these like humans walking around and then he goes back to sleep.","And then when he wakes up again, it's because these humans are making all this noise chopping wood and making these huts, primitive huts, and buildings and stuff.","And he's really annoyed, because this guy is chopping this uh tree that's growing on his head, and so he gets up and he walks off.","He finds this nice little hill to lie down on, he tries to sleep, but then the humans come with ropes and they grab him and drag him away and uh he's upset about this obviously.","Um and they start chipping away at him and they make him into a um grain mill.","And so he's spinning on this grain mill um grinding uh wheat into flour and ... that's powering him.","And there's all these other stones that are like have eyes and are sentient and being used for various tools.","And all of a sudden, there's these guys, these soldiers, in blue uniforms, and I think they're American revolutionaries and they see the big stone wheel, and they take it, and they break him up and make him into a cannon ball.","So now he's this little round ball with a nose and eyes um and they load him into a cannon and shoot him at this enemy British ship and he breaks a mast, by a","and the um, the, uhh, ","the ship sinks, ","and he gets broken into like little smaller pieces, and he floats to the bottom of the ocean, and then he uh, oh I can't remember exactly, he like washes up on shore, ","uhh, he washes up on the shore and somehow he gets taken into this like kind of industrial era um industrial era um town.","And he gets made into something else, and I don't remember what, he gets made into something else.","Um, what was it? Hold on. ","Um.","Oh! He gets it made into ..","I don't remember. ","But anyways he gets like thrown into a street, he's made into something else and then he gets thrown into the street, and then there's this upset guy who's kicking him.","He kicks him along the street and eventually picks him up and throws him through a window, where his lady is at the table with this sort of foppish guy and the stone hits him in the head and bounces out another window and bounces out uh ","bounces down off the city into like this beach and then he's lying on the sands and um this big uh like big truck like one of those big scooper things, picks him up and a bunch of sand and dumps him in a truck.","And then the truck is taking him to a uh factory and they're being dumped on this conveyor belt which is taking him out to a giant vat of molten stuff.","And the rock is really scared, and like this is the end, and he pours into the molten pot and he's reborn as this piece of glass.","And then the piece of glass, there's these guys in like uh in uh dust coats, or not dust coats you know those bee suits, and it covers him, and then gets placed onto this satellite, which gets sent into space, ","and now he's really excited and then the satellite shoots its engines and the satellite runs into the asteroid belt where it crashes, which breaks the lens a little bit, and then he crashes back and forth until they finally uh crash land onto a planet.","And then he's just alone on this planet, and um he's just alone on this planet and eventually somehow, he forms this big boulder again and the planet around him becomes terra form so there's these plants growing, ","he's getting into this big mountain again, he's a big mountain again, and he like wakes up and he looks around and he sees the big planet and it's all peaceful and he like sighs and then he relaxes and he falls back asleep.","Um trying really remember what else he gets turned into, I can't remember.","He gets made into the cannon ball, he's at the bottom of the ocean,","I don't remember","Okay, um.","I think that's all the videos, so I'm done."],"duration":{"_EnumKey_":[12,4,11,10,17,8,3,6,9,5,2,14,7,16,15,1,13,18,19,20,22,21],"_EnumValue_":{"_ArraySize_":155,"_ArrayType_":"uint8","_ArrayZipType_":"zlib","_ArrayZipSize_":155,"_ArrayZipData_":"eJwNyUESwyAMBMFCMlppZYHBSf7/1HCY6sM00Uu6AQqIB9PvIMA69eGzHqwUzCpOMOEb3P1QqX6m\nCCXtro0UtWmDFpiIcKIO0iO2OAZkSWhrq6HCks7SWKb+Nsv1KT541vhOHe+vkZn4A5t5BZo=\n"}}}}},

who was Leonardo DiCaprio - they asked him: who caught him?","And he said, um, Carl, har- some weird last name like carrot, v, and then it flashed back to the situation he was in the jail.","Um and I guess in another land, so it was not in the US, and the FBI agent Carl, he came to um, try to bring him back to the US, to US land, and he tried.","He was really sick so the Carl guy told the officers there to take him to the doctor's office but while they were at the doctor's office the officers didn't want to bring him a nurse.","While they were talking and washing their hands um the William Frank guy - the conman artist - he tried to escape but he was really sick so they caught him and that's when that one ended.","Um and then I think the next one was called ","So it's like a cartoon and then the girl was trying to eat a pizza slice but then she hears the doorbell.","And then she gets this record, or maybe it was called ","She gets the record and then she plays it but then she realizes that her pizza's gone.","And then she realizes that the record actually forwards or rewinds her life, so she plays around with it.","And ends up being like an adult, pregnant, and then she goes back and is not pregnant, goes back and is pregnant, and then she forwards and has the kid in her hands - the baby in her hands.","And then um she goes backwards accidentally as a little kid and then she goes forward and is like, old.","Um but then she's like old and is on a kind of wheelchair and has like a cast on her leg.","So she can't really touch the record so that she can go backward.","So she keeps going back and forth and gets upset.","And then she um, and so, forwarding to being like, old, I guess, in a home, and then basically, then I think she tries to go back but she cannot.","And so it just forwards and it just shows her that she died and shows her in the, just her like remains.","And then the, I think the next one - the next movie - was the one, something about robots.","But I forgot the name of the movie.","But basically it's like a husband and wife together and just like their anniversary.","But they don't look very happy, and they're just eating and the wife offers him some wine but he doesn't want to.","And she gets upset because she says, ","And uh, she ends up drinking like most of the wine.","And then she gets really upset, but before she gets upset, she's, he kind of says, ","And she tells him, ","Well she says it's an aphrodisiac and he asks, ","She says, ","But then she just sits there and then she gets really upset and throws the wine at him.","And then he just starts smoking.","She gets upset and takes the cigarette and tries to turn it off.","But then he takes another cigarette and starts smoking.","And so, um, then she said something really mean about him.","And then she goes over to him and hugs him but then she goes behind him and turns him, turns him off.","So we find out that he's just like a robot.","And then, she goes back to her computer while he's like, off, so he's not functioning anymore, and she's looking up another like, to get a new husband, a new robot husband.","But while she was doing that we see the picture of like, her being married to the other one.","So then she wants like a sportier, like, like more like, spontaneous robot.","So she calls and say her current model has malfunctioned, um he has no ambition, um and so they say, ","And so then, they ask her which one does she want, and she told them, oh like a masseuse, or rock climber, and then she wants both, with short hair.","So then we see the people from the robot company - I think it was like ","And then she looks like she's a little sad so then she runs to the old model - to her original husband - she runs over to him, kisses him, and then she sits down again with her new model, with her new robot husband.","Meanwhile she had already taken the ring off of her old husband - robot husband - and placed it on the new one and then turns him on.","And so they're sitting there, eating, and um she offers him wine and he says, ","But then he says that the asparagus is tender and that people say that it's an aphrodisiac.","So she gets happy because that's something she said before.","Um and then he goes over and gives her a massage.","And then she's very happy, but then he ends up turning her off, so then we find out that she was a robot, too.","So then he leaves her there and goes over and sits down on the couch with a cigarette and starts watching like sports.","And I think that's when that one ended.","Um, and then I think the next one was - one second, I'm thinking.","I think this was the one with uh, the stick figures - not sure.","But there was one about Keith Reynolds, I think that's what it was called.","And um, so basically, it's like stick figures, and he's like driving his car to his job and - you see all the levels of the company at the same time, he like walks in.","He's very excited because he thinks he's going to get a promotion.","He walks upstairs um, to where his dream girl, his crush is.","And he always offers her coffee, but she never wants it, uh and then he goes up, to actually talk to his boss, but there's somebody else there.","I forgot his name - I think Patrick - Patrick's already there and they're shaking hands, and he leaves and then so he goes in to talk to his boss.","But he says the handshake, well he doesn't say it - there's a narrator the whole time - but the narrator says that the handshake is like, was not as strong as he thought it would be.","And then, he didn't get the promotion he wanted to, actually the promotion was given to Patrick.","Meanwhile Patrick goes to the floor where Sarah is - the dream girl - the Reynolds', Keith Reynolds' dream girl.","And he tells her about the promotion and then they're very happy, hugging and kissing.","And so then Keith leaves very sad, and he goes down the elevator to the floor where Sarah is, sees them together.","And it says that the door, elevator door, was open longer than usual.","And so, then Patrick comes in.","And then they go up some floors and then Patrick comes, was gonna come out, but then Keith said some bad words, I guess some three-letter words, he didn't want to say.","And then Patrick gets upset, and punches him in the face.","So then Keith gets upset and starts hitting him and then ends up killing him.","And so he has to now dispose of the body to get home, I guess.","And then he takes it out of the elevator and is going to down the stairs with it.","Meanwhile there's another lady who works there, who likes to go to the seventh floor bathroom because for some reason she likes the soap dispenser there.","But she has some New Year's resolution to take the stairs so she starts going up the stairs.","So then as he's going down the stairs, she took, the lady who's going to the seventh floor bathroom, ends up seeing Keith carrying Patrick's dead body.","And she like, gets really surprised, like shocked, and she faints, falls off the stairs, and cracks her neck I guess.","Weird thing, and dies.","And so, he leaves her there, and he decides he's going to go through the window, through the ladder, so that he doesn't have to go through security.","So then he throws the body off of the, out the window, um, somebody sees the body that fell out the window, so, um.","Well beforehand, before the whole thing started, something had fallen off the window.","I think at the beginning and they called an ambulance.","But back to the part where I was at, um, so he's on the ladder and starts thinking about his life choices, ","and he starts thinking about how everybody wants to get a better job, and everybody wants the dream girl, and so maybe the decisions he made weren't the best decisions.","So, I think that's where that one ended.","And then, I think this is when we get into the next set.","There's one that was called The Pri-,","well I think first, it was the one about the shoe.","So, there's this guy and first he starts off with just a shoe - he's tapping his shoe.","And then, you see his, him drinking milk, checking his milk.","He's going to drink his milk.","And then, he sees a girl across the street, um, he seems to like her.","And so, he leans on the car that he's at, but it ends up not being his car.","So then the owner comes and is like, upset, and so he just leaves the car, and starts walking across the street from the girl.","And starts like, doing different body movements, and she's copying the same body movements.","And like he'll put the - he put up the - milk carton, and she like did the same body movement.","Um, bent down, she did the same body movement.","So they were like mimicking each other the whole time.","But then, he gets to the corner of the street, and like she stops and starts waving to tell him to stop because the car is coming.","But he doesn't register it as: there's an actual danger, but as: oh, she's still playing with me.","So then the car ends up hitting him, like really hard.","And then the car ends up roll- like flying in the air.","And in the end, all you see is like, one shoe, and then the other shoe really squashed.","And, uh, the girl is like very surprised.","And so I think that's when that one ended.","Um, and then there was the one about the prisoner.","So then the guy, he's really confused about where he is.","So he tells the lady at the restaurant.","She had like a maid outfit.","She told, he asked her, where he is, and where the police is, and she doesn't really give him the answer he's looking for.","So he walks away.","He goes over to where the telephone is and he tries to make a phone call.","But the lady asked him for a unit number.","And, well first he asks which register it is, and she asked for unit number, and he says, ","So she says there's no phone call then.","And so then he ends up call- asking for a taxi, and then this Asian girl comes in like uh, golf cart taxi-looking thing.","And um, starts speaking to him in French.","He's surprised like she's spoken French, so they had a conversation about that.","Um, and so she drived, he asked her to drive him to the nearest town, but she tells him this, that it's a local service.","So he asked her to drive her the farthest away into town that - into the town that they are.","And she, and so then she drives him to like this store, and then she tells him it's 2 units.","But then he's confused so she says, ","And she does some weird hand sign with her eye- with her, on her eye, saying that, like um, 'see you later' or something like that.","So then he walks into the store, and then he goes over to the counter.","He asks the clerk, um for a map, and then um, he asks, ","And the guy says, ","And so the guy like goes over, is thinking about it, grabs this, like pamphlet-map-thing, and gives it to him.","It's the black and white one.","He opens it, but it's like a very plain map.","It just says the mountains.","The mountains.","Your village.","So it's like, there's like no names.","And so he asks, ","And so, he gives him the colored map, which is basically the same thing but in color.","So he like is, like confused and upset.","But then he like, somebody comes in and the clerk starts attending him.","And he tells him, he did the same sign as the Asian girl, with the ha- with the circle, on her eye, and see you later kind of thing.","So then he goes out, and I think that was that for that one.","And then, um, what's the next one?","One second.","Um, let's see, what was after that one?","I think that's all that I remember.","Let me see if I remember anything else.","Oh yes, okay.","There was the post-it love thing.","So, uh, there's these, oh here, there's two more that I remember.","Okay, there's the post-it love thing where this girl is making a copy and uh like there's like a divider and there's two copy machines.","There's a girl on the right side making copies, and a boy, a man, on the next side making copies.","I guess they're in like a company, at their job.","And then she- they look over at each other, and they smile.","And so, they go back to their desks and, but when he goes back to his desk, he sees like a file folder and he's like confused, because he didn't see that before.","He opens the file folder and he sees like a smiley face, with post-its.","So then he looks around to see who it was, and he looks to his left and the girl looks over at the same time, and gets like shy and looks back.","So he knew it was her.","So then the next, then it shows like the next day, or like another part of the day, she was going to her desk - pulls up the blinds, and then sees that there's like a sun, made out of post-its, so he had done that for her.","So then they start going back and forth with the post-its, um the next one I think was when he was in the restroom, was like fixing his tie.","And a guy comes in to use the bathroom, closes the bathroom stall door, and there's like a cloud with a heart made out of post-its that she made for him.","And then, she goes to a closet, um, and then she goes in turns on the light and there's like a bouquet of flowers made out of post-its.","So then they're very excited.","She's very excited so she grabs a whole bunch of post-its um and as she's coming out she like looks in a surprise, and like he had made this huge mural out of post-its of them two together, smiling.","Their faces together and with hearts.","And he was still working on it.","And she was like very happy and like in her face, she was so surprised.","And I think that's when that one ended.","And then there's the one about the black hole, where um he was making copy, trying to make copies, but the copy machine wasn't really working with him.","So he kicks the copy machine and then this sheet comes out with a huge black ink hole.","And he's confused so he puts it on the side.","And he's trying to make more copies.","Meanwhile, he like places his coffee cup on top of the black hole.","But then the cup goes inside, so, but he didn't notice that yet, until like he turned and he like looked at the hole and every time he would get close to it, it would make like a - a vibration sound.","So he puts his hand in, takes out the coffee cup and then he's like very surprised so he folds up the sheet and he sees that it's just a sheet of paper, puts his hands in, ","and he sees that he can go through, whatever object - solid object - so then he gets an idea and takes the sheet over to the vending machine.","And then sticks his hand in and is able to get a snickers bar out of the vending machine.","And so then he gets a better idea about going to, I guess, grab the money from the company.","So he goes over, meanwhile nobody's there, so it's like after hours.","He started the day off wanting to leave.","So then he goes over to the door, and puts the paper there and sticks his hand through the black hole, opens the door, goes in to the vaults, and then he places, he tapes a paper to the vault.","And starts putting his hand in and taking out all the money out of the vault.","But then he gets really greedy so then he goes to grab more and ends up putting his whole body inside of the vault.","But then, the paper falls down and so he's stuck in the vault.","So he's like knocking on the door of the vault.","And so that's where that one ended.","And let's see.","Okay then it was this really weird one.","There is this kid at the bus stop, with his headphones on.","He looks hot and tired.","He has a bag of ice cream - strawberry ice cream.","And then this lady comes out of nowhere, her like, car, black SUV, and like, comes out of it, leaves the door open, and the car's just rolling away and I guess somebody says anything about it.","So she's like on the, trying to talk on the payphone, and the payphone doesn't work, gets mad.","Um hits the payphone, and then walks over the kid at the bus stop and asks him to give her, to let her borrow his phone so that she can make an emergency call.","And then um he lends her his phone, she walks away, calls this person, gets upset.","Drop- knocks the phone on the floor, and breaks the phone.","The kid at the bus stop, the guy at the bus stop is upset, and says, ","Well he says, ","Meanwhile this guy in this like, old 50s-looking car, drives, drives in and is at a distance.","And um she walks away from the guy at the bus stop.","And the guy is following her because he wants the money.","And then the guy from the mys- the mysterious guy that just popped out of nowhere from the older car walks out.","He's like this really tall guy with old suspenders like, older style kind of clothing.","Walks out and like, ","um","asks who, basically who the kid around from the bus stop is, and she says ","The kid from the bus stop is like, weirded out because basically he just wants the money, he doesn't know the lady.","And then the lady's just like, ","Um and pulls out a gun.","And then the guy, the older guy, basically says, ","And so he does like a magic trick and pulls out this like little gun.","So they're aiming it at each other.","And then the lady hears like a noise and goes to the trunk of the car - of the older car - and opens the trunk, and is like very surprised by what happened.","Meanwhile, um, the magician guy is talking to the, to the bus stop kid, and telling him.","Uh and then the bus stop kid tells him, ","And then he has like this scarf with this weird tomb-looking thing with a cross on it, and starts saying some weird, I guess, spell kind of thing.","And the kid is just like, has a weird face, his eyes are rolling back and uh, he like, I guess, becomes like a dog.","But meanwhile before he like really realized that, the lady comes with the gun and shoots the magician guy while he's trying to like, fix the situation because he looks at his paper.","And he's says, he like realizes that maybe he said it wrong, so he's like reading over everything but before he can even do anything, the lady shoots the guy - the magician guy.","And then when the magician is on the floor, he shoots her back.","So they're both on the floor then the bus stop kid is just barking, and barking, then he hears barks back so he's like um following the barks.","And then, I guess the person that was, the girl that the lady was looking for, that was in the trunk was also turned into kind of like an animal, maybe like, ","um, what do you call it?","Hypnotized, I guess.","They were both like dogs, and they were barking at each other and acting like dogs, and then they just like walk away with each other.","And then that was the end of that one.","And, let me remember another one.","Let me see.","Oh yeah, okay.","There's the one about the rock.","And then, so it starts off this big, mountain-size rock is - the cutest nose - is like staring at, I guess, the water, and there's like life, living creatures in the water, and they're happy but then the rock lives many years so he sees time pass by.","He goes from the dinosaurs, and then it's, I guess, the ice age, and then it's just like modern times and it's like greenery.","But then um, he like gets cuts down and it becomes like a smaller rock, and it has like a good tree on him.","Well no, he gets cut down when, uh with the ice.","The ice comes over and cuts him down so he's like a smaller rock.","Then he's like in a greenery, modern day, I think.","And then he has like a tree sticking out of him.","But then there's somebody cutting the tree down, and he's like confused.","And then there's somebody else, some people like building something next to him, so he's like trying to sleep the whole time, and gets up and walks away and goes somewhere into the forest and tries to go to sleep.","But then somebody comes and grabs him and um takes him, makes like a wheel out of him for farming and then he's used and used so he cannot go to sleep.","And then the police comes, takes him, takes him out, takes him to uh, ","I guess,","oh, so the military.","I think it's the military comes in, uses him, turns him into like a little ball, and then uses him during war.","So he witnesses war, he gets used in a cannon.","Then he flies, falls into the sea, ends up somewhere else.","Um, he's a smaller rock.","He's trying to find some sleep.","Um, but then he gets grabbed- somebody takes him, he gets taken, ","and then um, ","I think because he had a, he becomes like a small rock, but he has a fossil behind him so, like an archeologist, I guess, finds him, takes him, and then puts him in a museum.","And in the museum, he cannot get sleep because there are so many people like watching him, so much noise, and getting close.","But somebody gets so close to the, to the glass and he falls down, falls into somebody's garbage can.","And ends up like rolling, getting thrown out, rolls uh, he gets thrown out and picked up by the garbage.","And then he's like thrown into the garbage.","But then he's like trying to sleep but then he gets picked up, thrown into the furnace and again into this hot- hot oven, and then he comes like a glass - a glass mirror.","And then the glass mirror gets placed on the, the glass mirror gets placed on the satellite and gets taken into space.","And then, ","um, but then I guess the satellite knocks into different, like different rocks - meteor rocks or different rocks - and like falls away and he like, falls into the atmosphere of a new planet and becomes like a big rock again, ","like the planet I guess, gets a similar atmosphere as it was initially, where he was initially with greenery and like he's so happy because now he finally gets his sleep.","And I think that was it for that one.","And then what else?","Let's see.","Okay.","I think I am done."],"duration":{"_EnumKey_":[5,19,7,11,13,16,14,10,15,9,4,12,8,3,6,2,17,18,1,24,20],"_EnumValue_":{"_ArraySize_":262,"_ArrayType_":"uint8","_ArrayZipType_":"zlib","_ArrayZipSize_":262,"_ArrayZipData_":"eJwVjltuQ0EIQ0WBOwzm1aTZ/1ZDf5BlW+bQDzOLPoeM2K67IyzLnci5iwbViV/KUH3MHOgsaz5I\nkWhjY1w0dXD4mBJ8hwrck5slIRnNGALG9hqiSDrbSJBDM1PcIGsUgacg+yQo57rq3H83EtOq1t14\nwDu17vSLD8MXHJ7zXky8UBoa5yiJdDFqqv5iG1V0rr3LV473ZZF5ZD6CBZgvvn8Jwg==\n"}}}}},

Me If You Can.","The segment opens on a, what appears to be a mid-70s game show, titled “To Tell the Truth.”","It opens with the announcer introducing 3 gentlemen who walk from backstage, each identically dressed in the uniform of an airline pilot.","He's introduced as Frank Abagnale, who was a con artist posing as an airline pilot, a pediatrician, and a third position, I can't recall.","They take a seat on the side of the stage, and a contestant, an older women with brown hair, asks the first of the Frank Abagnales why he had chosen to live as a con artist rather than with a legitimate career, ","and he replies that it was a matter of dollars and cents.","She goes on to ask the second Abagnale who it was that finally caught him.","And he replies that it was an FBI agent named Carl Hanratty.","And the segment then switches to Carl Hanratty in the rain outside a jail in Marseilles France.","He's trying to explain to the prison administration that he's there to see Frank Abagnale.","They admit him into the prison, and he's able to speak to Frank through a small slot in the prison cell.","Frank is covered in a blanket with much longer hair than seen in the first segment, and he's coughing heavily.","Carl reads from what seems to be a worn prison arrest.","Frank begins to cough heavily and collapses.","Carl asks the prison guard to get a doctor to remove Frank from his cell, to remove Frank from his cell and bring him to a hospital bed, and they tell Carl that a doctor would not be available until the next day.","Frank says that if, Carl says that if Frank dies under their watch, he will hold them responsible.","Meanwhile, Frank has escaped from the hospital, ","and down the hall of the main section of the prison, where the other inmates are encouraging his escape.","He's pursued by the guards, ","and one of the guards finally holds a gun to the back of his head, ","whereupon Frank again collapses,"," and tells Carl, “Let’s go home.”","The Record.","We see a computer-animated segment with a young woman sitting in an apartment.","She's about to eat a slice of pizza, when she hears a knock on the door.","She goes to answer the door, there's no one there, but there is a small package, which she takes inside, opens, and sees it is a small 45 record.","She puts it on the record player, and begins to eat her pizza but sees that a segment of it already appears to have been eaten.","By accident she discovers that the further the song progresses, the further into the future it will take her, and she experiments with this so that, over the course of the segment, it brings her a few years into the future, where she's in a nicer apartment and pregnant.","And then later.."," she pushes the song further into the future so that she has her child in her arms, but as it’s crying, it seems to annoy her, and she brings the song closer to its beginning, which pushes her into her childhood.","Then finally further into the future, where she's in a wheelchair, has difficulty approaching the record to change her position in time, ","and finally brings her further into the future, where she's a much older woman on a walker, and she's trying to approach the record in time to stop the song from ending.","She can't make it in time, and the segment ends with the woman as an urn of ashes.","The Boyfriend.","The segment is subtitled High Maintenance.","It opens with a man and a woman sitting at opposite ends of a long dinner table.","They're eating in silence.","The woman goes to pour the man a glass of wine.","He covers the glass with his hand, and says that he cannot drink.","The woman in retaliation pours herself two glasses of wine.","The man remarks that the asparagus is tender, to which she replies that it is an aphrodisiac.","The man asks, “Who says so?” and she replies, “It’s just something people say.”","She throws a glass of wine in his face.","He lights a cigarette.","He snubs the cigarette out at the other end of the room.","They're arguing.","It was their marriage anniversary.","She insults him, and later sees he’s upset.","She sits on his lap to console him, while with her hand moves behind his neck to turn off a switch that is there, and the man seems to be deactivated.","We learn that he was a robot, and we see the woman on the computer, looking at other models of robot.","She finally selects and orders one that she likes.","It arrives shortly thereafter.","They remove the older model, but she first kisses him and removes the wedding ring, and places it on the newer one.","The opening scene seems to repeat with much of the same dialogue, but with a much more favorable rapport to the woman.","The man makes his way over to the other side of the table and begins to massage her shoulders, ","and finally pulling the switch on the back of her neck, revealing her to also be a robot, ","and whereupon he relaxes, lights a cigarette, and watches television.","The Shoe.","There's a text on the screen saying, “How do they get there?” with an image of a shoe on the pavement.","You see it belongs to a man, who’s leaning against a car and drinking a carton of milk.","The owner in the car, the owner of the car, a older gentleman in a tank top, shoos the man away, ","and he goes walking down the sidewalk, ","where he notices a girl on the opposite side of the street in a red sweater, who begins to imitate his movements.","They go back and forth, imitating various gestures.","When the girl begins to warn him of an oncoming car, which he interprets as a new gesture to imitate and is hit by the car,  ","and his shoe gets knocked off and goes flying through the air and lands on the side of the curb.","The camera pans down the curbside, where we see another shoe, presumably from an earlier similar incident.","The Rock.","There is a large mountain, I'm assuming in the Prehistoric Age.","It’s a very sleepy mountain, and as time passes, ","the mountain gets reduced to the size of a hill, on which a tree is growing, and some men cut down the tree to begin building a cabin.","And the rock is annoyed by the noise and gets himself up and moves over to a mountainside.","And he's pulled from the mountainside and hitched to a mule, where he is fashioned into a millstone,  ","and then later is taken by soldiers, fashioned into a cannonball, ","fired at a ship, broken into a number of pieces, and then as the fragment settles in a river.","He's later found by an archaeologist with a fossilized crustacean on his back and displayed in a museum.","An excited child, pounding against the glass of the exhibit, pushes the rock ","down into a garbage chute, I believe.","He's finally reduced to a grain of sand, which is collected and fashioned into a lens ","that is to be a part of a satellite, which is shot into space,"," crashes, and enters upon a different planet, very much like the scene at the beginning, and he's formed as a mountain again and finally gets to sleep.","The Prisoner.","We see a man dressed all in black.","He approaches a woman in a cafe.","He's asking where he is.","She's unable to help him, and he finds his way over to a telephone.","He wants to make a phone call, but he does not know a number, and the operator disconnects.","At an information board, he is able to summon a taxi, which can only take him within the town itself.","He gets out of the taxi and enters a general store, where he asks for a map.","It’s a very multicultural, cosmopolitan kind of town.","The taxi driver appears to be Asian, and she addressed the man in black in both English and French, and they mention the Poles and Czechs.","The keeper of the general store, I believe, was addressing customer in Italian.","He asks the storekeeper for a map.","The storekeeper first produces a small one in black and white, which only shows the local area, but surrounded by mountains.","The man in black asks for a larger map.","The storekeeper produces this one in color, but simply a larger version of the same local area, and he remarks that other maps are not in demand.","When the man in black exits the store, the storekeeper says, “I’ll be seeing you,” which was the same closing salutation used by the taxi driver.","The Bus Stop.","You see a man standing on a street corner at a bus stop.","This is a very hot day.","He's sweating, and he has a carton of ice cream in a plastic bag he's holding.","He’s listening to his headphones waiting for the bus, when there is at the side of the frame an SUV stopped outside of a pay telephone.","A woman gets out and attempts to use the phone, is frustrated, smashes the phone back in the terminal.","She approaches the man at the bus stop, asking if she could use his phone.","She's very arrogant.","He complies, and she gets a few steps away and makes a phone call.","She's very distraught and seems to be angry with the person she's speaking to and asking about another person’s welfare.","She smashes the phone against the ground, ","and the man at the bus stop remarks that it is broken, and asks if he could have maybe sixty dollars to help replace it.","She pays him no attention.","A second vehicle arrives and parks under a bridge.","A man exits, and this seems to be the person whom the woman was waiting for or speaking to earlier on the phone.","The man at the bus stop recognizes the man in the car as a magician named Aldini, who often performs at a local casino and recognizes the woman as his assistant.","The assistant goes to the trunk of Aldini’s car and opens it.","We cannot see what she sees, but she appears very distraught by what she sees in the trunk of the car, and she pulls a gun on Aldini, who produces one of his own.","The assistant fires into the air.","While the assistant was inspecting the trunk of the car, Aldini performed a kind of spell over the bus stop man, which at first seemed to hypnotize him, causing him to lose consciousness, ","and then upon wakening, seemed to believe that he was a dog, ","and he laps at the melted ice cream that had spilled from his bag earlier.","Aldini and his assistant are both at a stand-off, and each shoots the other.","The man from the bus stop, who is now behaving as if he were a dog, begins to crawl down the street.","And then we see a second person as a dog, a woman who possibly was in the trunk of Aldini’s car,","and then they go together as dogs.","I can’t remember the title of an animated sequence, which was done entirely in the profile of a multi-story office building.","I believe it was called Philip Reynolds, after the main character.","Philip Reynolds has worked in the office for 8 years, and today he is expecting a promotion.","He first takes the elevator up to an employee’s lounge, where every day he offers a cup of coffee to his coworker Sara, who every day refuses.","And today she tosses the coffee out the window, which seems to hit a window washer in the face and cause him to fall.","And while this is happening, another employee at the company, possibly Philip’s rival, ","his last name is Campbell, ","has received a promotion of his own, possibly the one that Philip was waiting for.","Campbell goes to tell Sara the news of his promotion.","She's pleased, and they're kissing in the employee’s lounge.","Meanwhile, Philip has discovered that he has not been promoted, and he goes back downstairs to the lounge to discover Campbell and Sara kissing.","Campbell goes onto the elevator.","And Reynolds kills Campbell in the elevator,","later dragging him out to one of the upper floors, and dragging his body down the stairs.","They soon find another employee who’s taken the stairs, rather than the elevator, as part of her New Year’s resolution, and she faints,  ","and Reynolds finally has the idea to use the ladder he had earlier seen against the outside of the building and exit with Campbell’s body.","I believe Campbell’s body falls to the ground, and when Reynolds goes out the window onto the ladder, the ladder begins to sway.","And Reynolds is face-to-face with a janitor whom he had never seen before, and

the young woman, who was watching his reaction, "," and later that day or the next day, the young woman approaches her cubicle and raises the blinds and finds post-it notes in the shape of a sun

to malfunction and produces a sheet of paper with a large black circle in the center, which he puts to the side, and continues to make his copies.","He finishes a cup of coffee, which he

so the first movie was Catch me if you can with Leonardo di Caprio and it starts with 3, with a like a TV show, a game show I guess, with 3 men, ","all of them wearing the same clothes and kind of like a briefcase, and Leonardo di Caprio's in the middle.","And I guess the premise is that they are all 3 they are con men, and they go by the same name, they are Frank something Abagnale.","And they have different professions and lead different lives but they're all the same man.","And so in this talk show I guess, this woman is asking them questions, and she asks the first man, why, you know being as smart as he is, why he chose to be a con man, and he answered, the answer was about the money.","The second question was to the second man, the man in the middle, Leonardo di Caprio, um, and the question was who caught you?","And the answer was he gave the name, I don't remember, and then they flashbacked to that, I guess, cop telling some other people, and I think it's raining, um, that he is this man like he's telling other people who he is.","I think this was in France, 1969 or something like that, and telling them who he is and he keeps repeating his name.","I guess because of his credentials, and um he needs to see Frank Abagnale.","And so he, they let him, and they're very strict about what he can do in this tiny room that is not very good looking, and I guess Frank is in solitary confinement and he's in a cell, and he's coughing, and he's so sick.","And I guess the cop person wants to take him back to the United States for some reason and he's reading this document to him, I guess it's something legal, and Frank is just coughing and coughing and coughing and then he passes out.","And the cop freaks out and says you need to call the cops.","Also he's carrying an umbrella because it's dripping in this cell place.","Um and they call the doctor or whatever, not really the doctor actually, but they take him to the hospital and then they want to leave him there overnight.","The cop is like what are you guys doing?","And they're washing their hands and they're like oh the doctor comes in the morning, or something like that, and then, and then they see, and he's so upset because he needs to take him back home he says to the United States soon and he's so sick.","And then they see that he has escaped that room, except they chase after him and he can't go very fast because he's so sick, so he's like actually just crawling and coughing his way out.","And I guess the cop grabs him by the hair and he just passes out, facing up, and actually kind of smiles.","I think, I mean he knows he's done.","Ah so that was the first movie.","The second movie is a cartoon I think.","Um and so this red-headed cartoon character sits on the couch, sits on this chair, and opens this envelope that has this uh what's it called, vinyl music, this disc, and she also has this slice of pizza in her hand.","So she's going to eat this pizza but then, plays the music, but then notices that as the music goes on, her pizza gets eaten.","And then she realizes that she can play, she can play with time through this disc.","So she does.","So she goes forward in time, she goes back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, kind of like short range, ","so kind of like, I don't know, within the same day, like her pizza gets eaten and then comes back and then eaten and comes back and then eaten and then come back.","But then she goes to later age, so she becomes like pregnant, and then she has a baby.","And she can keep going back and forth, and then she becomes like older and then she's on a wheelchair and then she becomes younger and she has a doll in her hand, and she's like a kid.","And then, she pushes it so far that she's dead.","So that movie ended.","That was fun.","Um I start to forget the order of the movies, but there's another movie where it was about a shoe and how it got there.","It was on the side of the road.","So how did the shoe get there?","So then there's this, goes to this guy who's walking around the sidewalk and notices that this woman on the other side of the sidewalk is kind of doing everything that he does, and it's very playful.","So the guy kind of trips, and she trips too.","He reaches up, oh he's drinking milk actually.","Yeah, yeah, yeah, he was drinking a carton of milk, by a car, and then he somehow has to leave because somebody is coming or something, I think somebody scares him away, and then he notices this woman.","He puts the carton of milk up like up high, and the woman also reaches up high.","He starts kind of skipping or dancing, and she starts doing it too.","And then it flips, so she starts doing something and he imitates.","But then, he's not paying attention to the road, because he's paying attention to her, and then she's trying to, she's trying to signal to him, that there's a car coming, but he thinks it's fun and games and then he gets hit by a car.","His shoe flies off, and that's how that shoe got there.","So that was intense.","I'm going to try to think for a second about the next, what else I saw.","Oh, there was a movie with stick figures.","Oh I think that was in the second round.","I don't know if it matters.","Anyway, REALLY intense movie with stick figures.","And I guess the punch line is everything is so fragile and you never know what's going to happen next.","And everybody wants the same thing I guess just like happiness.","Everything can change in the blink of an eye.","Alright, I think that was the punch line, but what happened is this guy is super excited.","He works at an office, like I don't know, he has like an office job, a day job, and he's like been there for a while but he you know, he's not, he doesn't have a great position, and he's like the most senior junior person.","But it's promotion day, and he's pretty sure he's going to get the promotion, probably because he's been there for so long.","He also, turns out, has a crush on this girl, who's also a stick figure, everybody's a stick figure, that works on a different floor.","He makes her coffee a lot, like she actually doesn't want the coffee.","She actually, I don't know how this is relevant, but she pours it out of the window, and actually I think kills the guy that is working on this ladder on the side of the window.","Anyway, the guy, the main character, whose name I can't remember, goes upstairs and finds out that he did not get the promotion because this other guy got it.","This other guy then goes to the fourth floor I think, where his, the lady is, and they start kissing.","The main guy is still upset that he didn't get the promotion, but is also obsessed with this girl, so he wants to go see if she wants another coffee.","He takes the elevator down, turns out the guy that got the promotion instead is there, talking to this lady, and they are kissing.","So he's just in shock and also the elevator door just takes forever to close.","They're still kissing.","And then, he asks the guy in the elevator, you know, the main guy, to leave the elevator door open for him.","So now they're sharing the elevator door, or the elevator.","And he can see his reflection in the mirror looking back at him, and he actually says to him well, three words that he, I guess regrets, but I'm guessing is go fuck yourself, ","anyway, the guy hits him, and the main guy hits him back, but so much, so aggressively, that he kills him.","And then, he decides that he needs to hide the body.","He decides to take the elevator, the stairs I think, because the elevator, well that would be, he would probably get caught.","Turns out as he's going down the stairs, this lady decides to go to the bathroom upstairs better she likes it better because it has better soap.","She also made a resolution to take the stairs, exercise more, I don't know if I made that up.","Anyway, she's taking the stairs up, she sees the guy and the dead body, mutilated body, and faints and also dies, because she faints on the stairwell, but the main guy is like, oh well, that was an accident, like not my fault.","Anyway he decides that he should not be taking the stairs.","He decides that he should be taking those weirdo stairs outside of the window, outside of the building, and as he's doing that, he actually drops the mutilated guy and he's just balancing there.","And that's where he sees the cleaning man.","And he realizes that you know, that's when the punch line comes in like, everybody just wants the same thing, everybody just wants to be happy, and wants a house, whatever.","So that ended.","Um what else.","Well there's a really weird movie with a guy, was wearing these white headphones and kinda looks terrible, he's wearing like sweatpants and is sweating, and he's carrying a bag that has ice cream and it's kind of melting, and he's waiting there.","The movie's called the Bus Stop even though, I guess he was waiting for the bus.","All of a sudden this woman is in this car, and like gets out of the car, and leaves the door open, and she, I don't know if she wanted to use this payphone, anyway, she comes to talk to this man and asks him if he has a phone.","And she's like don't worry, I'm not going to take it, blah blah blah.","He gives her a phone and she's like yelling on the cell phone, I'm going to call the cops, blah blah blah, this and that, and then she's so angry and she slams the phone on the floor.","The guy, the guy is just kind of standing there the entire time even though he sees his phone smashed on the floor, and then he comes, he goes, and checks it, and he's like it's broken.","And the woman just doesn't pay attention to him at all, but he's, he doesn't seem so upset, but he just follows her because he wants money, he wants her to pay him 60 dollars for the phone so he can get a new phone.","Meanwhile her car has been I think moving the entire time, anyway.","Eventually this car pulls in, and this guy comes out of the car, and the woman is walking towards the man and the main guy at the, with the headphones, is following the woman.","This guy gets out of the car and he starts interacting with the woman.","The old man, he's an older man, and he's clearly upset that this other guy is there, he's like, what do you know about me, blah blah blah, and she's like, nobody knows who you are, and they're having a heated, well she's very upset, ","and the guy's like no no no I don't know who, oh, the girl's like oh he's just a friend and he's like mehh, not really, I just want money for my phone, I don't know anything.","And then, she takes out like a gun and he takes out a fake gun, the woman is wondering where somebody is, she's like where is she where is she, what did you do to her, something like that.","Anyway, the old man, oh the main guy is like oh I know who you are, you're a magician and you're the assistant.","And um meanwhile they're like pointing guns at each other and then actually the magician guy hypnotizes the main guy, and it doesn't go right, but he ends up turning into a dog.","He ends up behaving like a dog.","His ice cream melted, it's all over the floor, and the two, and the magician shoots the assistant, the assistant shoots the magician.","Oh also before, while the guy was being hypnotized, the woman checks the trunk of the car, and is so upset, that's why she shoots the magician.","She's so upset at what she sees in the trunk.","And I have an i-, I think that what she sees in the trunk is the person she was looking for, the woman she was looking for turned into a dog, I think, ","because when the main guy's a dog, this other woman dog who's wearing what looks like uh the clothes that you would wear at the hospital, like a gown, a hospital gown, is also a dog.","And then they're like hanging out.","In the end the guy seems happier, because now he has a friend.","He just didn't seem very happy before, now I don't know, these two dogs, this woman and this man, are just like hanging out and playing with each other.","All right, next movie, let's see.","Oh my gosh, there's one with a rock.","So it starts being a mountain and it transforms, transforms, transforms with time.","It has eyes, so this is also an animated movie.","And yeah, just we follow the life of this rock, this mountain, as it goes on and on and on with time and it goes to different places with technology, and in the end it goes into space, so.","You know, and the whole time, this piece of rock just wants to sleep, it just wants to sleep.","And it goes into this fan and it goes into I don't know, a factory I guess, and it gets handled so much and it's so tired at the end.","Oh it's in a museum, it gets kicked like a pebble on the street, so much stuff happens to it and it's so tired and it just wants to sleep.","I think in the end it does sleep. I don't remember.","Oh my gosh, okay, actually the third movie, I'm pretty sure, was the Boyfriend, and this was so creepy.","Okay so there's this, it starts with something about ambition, I don't know why it said ambitious on the screen, it said it, in text, ","but anyway, this woman and this man are at the dinner table and they're like wealthy, I don't know, they're having this fancy dinner, the kind of dinner that like one of them is on one side of the long table and the other on the other, ","and they're eating like asparagus and you can hear like the click, like the clicking of the like fork and knife as they cut their food.","And they're being very like formal, and they're referring to each other as dear and it's their anniversary.","And she's clearly very, well she's very upset because she wants to pour him wine, and he can't because he's on call.","I guess he's a doctor or something.","And then he's like you know I can't drink when I'm on call, and she's so upset and she just chugs her wine and then pours herself another glass, and she's so disappointed in him, and he is like, the asparagus is so tender, dear.","And she's like yeah, it's an aphrodisiac, and he's like, why do you say that, and she's like, well that's just what people say.","And he's like oh, and she's sooo angry at him because I guess she wants to have sex, and he's so cold or something.","And then she's like, she like pours her water glass on his face, and he's so angry and he starts smoking.","She also, she's like uh just like I don't even know why you can't drink, going from stupid dinner to stupid conversation, stilted conversation, if I'm lucky, to make short mechanical sex, ","which ended up being interesting, because, well that's when he starts smoking and she's so upset, she's like you do NOT smoke in my house, and puts out his cigarette.","But he lights another one.","And she's so angry, but then she goes over to him, and she's like I'm so sorry for what I said, probably referring to the sex comment, I'm so sorry I didn't mean it, and she's massaging his head, caressing his head, and then, turns him off.","Okay, so he's a robot, so that's weird.","And then she goes, like just lets go and like just puts her feet on the dinner table.","And then actually goes online, or to her computer, and actually checks out another robot.","So now she's thinking about getting another robot, and this one is clearly just like not as um I don't know, formal-looking as the last one.","Um I don't know if his name was Paul or something, anyways, she calls this company, robot company, and she's like oh I'm not satisfied with my current product.","And they're like oh I'm so sorry, what's the problem, she's like, oh I don't remember what she said but I don't remember what she said, but it was something like he lacks a sense of adventure or something.","And they're like, oh yeah that's a common problem or fault or with that model.","Uh so do you want an upgrade to a different model?","And she's like yes please.","Ok well do you know what you want?","And she's like I want a, somebody with a sense of adventure, right?","Like a rock climber or a masseuse, ooh can it be a rock-climbing masseuse?","And they're like yeah yeah no problem.","So they bring in a new robot, these two like blonde chicks bring in a new, you know formal-looking, I feel like we're in the future now, I mean, and then, by the way, everybody has an accent in this movie.","And then, they bring in this other man, this other robot man, and he's off, but I guess she turns him on.","Also she is like, wait, before they leave, and takes off his ring, gives him a kiss in the lips and lets them take the old robot.","And then she puts on the ring on the new robot, like the wedding ring, and wakes him up, or you know, turns him on.","And now they're having dinner.","And it's kind of similar, it's weird, because he's also commenting on how the asparagus is tender, but then HE is like oh I hear it's an aphrodisiac.","And she smiles.","Oh also before that, she offers wine and he's like no I have a big climb tomorrow, which is very interesting, ","because it's like, you know what, everybody, I don't know it made me think there's problems with everybody, right, like you can design the perfect man but like yeah good luck with that, anyway.","Um so he's like no I have a big climb tomorrow, I can't drink, and she's like oh, God.","That's what she thinks to herself I'm sure.","But then he makes a comment about the aphrodisiac and she's like oh okay maybe this is better, and then he comes over and starts massaging her, which is the masseuse part, right, and she's so happy.","And he's like how was your day, tell me about your day, which is the same thing that the other guy asked, which is also interesting.","She starts telling him about her day, and goes on and on about how she went into town, and whatever, oh had lunch with Anna, and since it was their anniversary, and then, he turns her off.","So she was a robot.","And then he just kicks back on the couch, and smokes.","So that was an interesting movie.","And I'm struggling to remember, let's see.","Let's see what

okay, so uh, well first of all, both sequences began with an ad for concessions with dancing popcorn, dancing candy bar, and an invitation to go to the lobby and get candy.","After that the first film that we saw was the opening to Catch me if you can.","It started with a uh game show um with uh three individuals all claiming to be William Abagnale.","And then some questions were asked of them, and I guess the point of the show was to try to determine who was actually William Abagnale.","Then it went to a clip of a character played by Tom Hanks, whose name I forget, who was pursuing William Abagnale.","And it was at a prison in Marseilles, France.","And William Abagnale was being held there.","He was very sick and asked to see a doctor.","When he went to see the doctor, he escaped briefly.","And uh Tom Hanks' character and the prison guards pursued him and eventually caught him, uh at which point William Abagnale said something like ","Um the next movie that I saw was called The Record.","And it began with an animated character sitting at home, eating pizza, and she put on a record.","And when the record skipped, she realized that a piece of the pizza was gone ","and eventually put it together that um the record was somehow locked to the progress of time so that she could travel through time by either skipping forward in the record or skipping backward in the record, or playing the record backwards, et cetera.","She then played around with this for a bit, playing the record forwards, backwards, observing time going forwards and backwards, and then skipped forward quite a bit, at which point she was pregnant.","The sequence proceeded like this, she had a baby, it skipped forward quite a bit, and she was in a wheelchair, and kept skipping in a way that was annoying to her and comical.","Then she was very old and she noticed that the record was about to play out, at which point she panicked and tried to stop it but it was too late, and then the next shot is her as an urn of her cremated ashes presumably.","Um let's see I'm having trouble remembering what the next one is.","Oh okay there was one about a character named Keith Reynolds who, so this is an animated 2-dimensional movie, about a character named Keith Reynolds,","who's showing up to work and expecting a promotion that day after having worked very hard for a long time towards this promotion.","Um he goes into the elevator, goes up to a floor, maybe a floor that he works on, and there's a female employee who he's had a crush on for a while, ","and uh there's some context given at this point, where um he makes her coffee every day, she's not really interested in the coffee, but he does this anyways, in an attempt to flirt with her.","So he does this as usual, she pours the coffee out the window, doesn't appear very interested in him.","Then he proceeds to the top floor where he anticipates he'll be given a promotion.","And as he's getting off the elevator, another man, named Patrick Campbell I believe, is getting on the elevator, after having just received the promotion that Keith Reynolds expects to be getting.","Patrick Campbell then goes down the elevator to the floor where the female employee was, I forget her name, and he tells he got the promotion, they embrace in a kiss.","Um at that point it goes back to Keith Reynolds who's receiving news that he didn't get the promotion.","So he goes back to the elevator, goes back downstairs to perhaps to flirt with the female employee again, um, and at that point he sees her making out with Patrick Campbell.","And he's obviously very upset about this.","Patrick Campbell gets on the elevator with him, they're going up the elevator, Keith Reynolds says something to Patrick Campbell that offends him, ","Patrick Campbell punches Keith Reynolds in the face, at which point Keith Reynolds in an act of rage uh murders Patrick Campbell and he panics, he's trying to figure out what to do with the body.","He decides it's best to go down the stairs.","At that point, another employee is coming up the stairs, because it was her resolution to use the stairs more often, and she witnesses Keith Reynolds walking down with Patrick Campbell's dead body, uh she passes out and falls down the stairs and I believe dies.","Then he continues down the stairs with Patrick Campbell's body, uh, I think he eventually sees the woman who he had a crush on, she faints.","He tries to climb out the window with Patrick Campbell's body, um, and looks like drops Patrick Campbell's body, and then he's sort of suspended on a ladder for a while and the scene closes with him looking through the window at a janitor.","There's another movie that I didn't catch the title of the movie, but it begins with a man drinking a carton of milk, and he's leaning against a car.","Another man comes up and looks upset at him for leaning against the car, presumably it's the car of the man who just walked up.","Then the man who's drinking the carton of milk starts to walk down the street.","He notices, he trips over the curb, and at that point he notices that a woman who's walking on the opposite side of the street, pretends to trip, imitating or mocking him.","He notices that, so then an exchange unfolds where he makes a silly gesture, she imitates the silly gesture, and so on.","But I guess distracted by this, he doesn't notice that he's walking into the street.","She tries to stop him from walking into the street, but he still thinks it's part of the exchange they're having, so he imitates her motion that's intended for him to stop walking into the street.","He's hit by a car and the car somehow goes flying over a tow truck I think.","And then it's not clear what happens but maybe he died.","Umm let's see, there's a sequence called Post-it Love.","There are some employees in an office who are flirting by leaving uh images made out of post-it notes for each other.","So for instance, one of them leaves a folder that has, actually I don't remember, maybe a heart made out of post-it notes.","Another one leaves a series of post-it notes arranged on a wall so that it portrays a bouquet of flowers.","I don't remember the exact sequence of events but the images themselves escalate into more and more elaborate artwork made out of post-it notes.","Until eventually one of the characters is coming out of what looks like a supply room with a bunch of post-it notes, presumably to presumably to make another image of this sort,","and then she sees on a large wall, the male employee who she's been flirting with has made a very, very elaborate detailed image of both of their faces next to each other, I think surrounded by hearts, with the post-it notes.","And that's the end of the sequence.","There's a sequence called The Boyfriend.","It begins with a couple sitting across the table from one another having dinner.","Things appear a little tense.","It turns out it's their anniversary, the woman tries to pour the man a glass of wine and he refuses and says he's on call, the implication that he's a doctor probably?","Um and then she gets upset at him, she, it seems that there's some tension already in the relationship but she seems to think he's rather mechanical and he seems frustrated with her.","It turns out he's not actually a doctor, he's some sort of computer analyst.","And so it seems kind of silly that he didn't want to have any wine while he was on call.","He mentions something about how the asparagus is tender and she says that's an aphrodisiac, or she says, they say it's an aphrodisiac, and his response is ","And she's taking it very literally, and she looks very upset by this.","At one point she throws wine on him, he starts smoking a cigarette inside, she gets upset, she puts it out, he starts smoking a cigarette inside again, ","um, and uh she sort of pretends that she's trying to, oh right, she yells at him that she's upset about the relationship in general, that he's very mechanical and that the most she can hope for is that later they'll have some short mechanical sex, ","I think that's how she puts it, and then she says, sorry, or at least pretends to apologize, walks over to him, sits next to him, and at that point the camera cuts to the back of his neck, where you see there's an on-off switch, ","and while she's pretending to comfort him, she actually turns him off.","So at that point it's obvious he's a robot of some sort.","And um she is then looking on a website that appears to have a number of other similar robot models.","So she calls the company, she says she's dissatisfied by the product, and describes the way that she's dissatisfied, they say that those are common malfunctions for this model, um, she orders another one.","She requests specifically a rock-climber who's also a masseuse with a 5-o'clock shadow.","The next scene, there's a knock at the door, someone is delivering her new robot boyfriend model, they come in, they take the old one out, she kisses him goodbye, then they set up the new model, and it's back to the anniversary dinner scenario.","He still doesn't want to have a glass of wine because he has a big climb the next day, so that's a little, that's a bit of a red flag for her, ","but then, he mentions himself that asparagus is an aphrodisiac, so um then she seems excited by that, ","he goes over, starts giving her a massage, and uh I don't remember the exact sequence of events but the twist is that he then actually turns her off, so it turns out that she was a robot as well, ","and then he goes over, lights a cigarette and starts watching TV, and I believe that's the end of the sequence.","Um there's another movie called the Black Hole.","It starts out with a man using a photocopier in an office, and he tries to make a photocopy and what comes out is a piece of paper with a very large black circle filled in disc on it.","And he's puzzled by this, he takes it out, he sets it next to the copier, he tries to put his cup that he's drinking from down on the piece of paper, but instead of resting there, it falls through.","And so he's very confused by this, he starts to investigate.","He realizes he can put his hand through this, the black hole in the piece of paper, and reaches in there and actually pulls out his cup,","but he realizes that essentially this piece of paper, the hole on the piece of paper, whichever surface he puts the paper on, it's as though there's now a hole in that surface.","So he goes first to the snack vending machine in the office, puts the piece of paper on the glass pane on the machine and reaches through and grabs a snack of some sort.","Then, he uh takes the piece of paper to a locked room in the office, puts the piece of paper on the door so he can now reach through the door, opens the door, goes into the room where there's a safe, ","puts the piece of paper on the front of the safe, reaches in, starts taking money out.","Then he's reaching in, trying to reach further into this safe, and actually climbs into the safe, at which point the piece of paper actually falls off, so now he's trapped in the safe.","That's the end of that sequence.","Um there's another sequence uh called The Rock.","And um in that one, it starts off with the history of a particular rock.","So it starts off with some geological events, shifting around of mountains, glaciers, this sort of thing.","And then it's a rock on the property of what looks like, it looks like a farm.","It starts off with a man cutting down a tree on top of the rock.","The rock seems annoyed by this and all of the busy activity going on it around it, so it gets up and walks away deeper into the forest where it can rest.","Then at one point it's pulled out of the dirt that it's lodged in by a horse with a rope tied to it, it's taken and um I guess turned into the uh wheel in a mill grinding grain down into flour, so it becomes the wheel in a mill.","Then it seems like maybe northern soldiers in the civil war seize it from the mill and grind it down into a cannon ball, and it's fired off of a ship in a civil war battle.","And it seems like it breaks into pieces maybe, and is washed into the ocean.","Then it is washed back on shore at one point, walks around for a bit, um it's gotten much smaller by this point, ","then it's picked up by I guess an archeologist, uh paleontologist who sees it as a fossil inside of the rock and is very excited about this, puts the rock on display in a museum.","Then a very excited child presses his face against the glass and that knocks the rock out of the display.","It bounces around for a bit throughout the city, I don't remember the exact sequence, but eventually it's crushed by a steamroller, and so at that point it's basically a piece of sand, ","um so it's swept onto the beach, then the sand is collected and turned, taken to a factory where they make glass, and I guess it becomes the lens for a telescope.","Um and then uh so it's the lens for a telescope, something goes haywire with the telescope, it's launched into space, um, then it crashes into I don't know maybe one of the moons of Saturn?","Um and then uh it becomes a rock again on Saturn basically and it looks like life is starting to form there, there are some plants, and so I guess the implication is maybe uh the whole cycle starts over again.","Um let's see.","I feel like I'm forgetting an entire movie.","Yeah I know there is one more movie, but I just can't remember what it was right now."],"duration":{"_EnumKey_":[19,5,12,7,13,4,16,10,6,17,15,18,8,14,9,21,3,11,22,20,27,23,2,30],"_EnumValue_":{"_ArraySize_":104,"_ArrayType_":"uint8","_ArrayZipType_":"zlib","_ArrayZipSize_":104,"_ArrayZipData_":"eJwFwQsWxDAEAMBHCJGi9Lf3P+nOAA5ioolCuoz34aFiRCZ5Vu55spkjN40u3do9rppecWPC0oex\nWuhNDU+L2Rx78UfttMYPVEXvAwA//APGXgQD\n"}}}}},

before the first seven movies started, there was like an old-fashioned music jingle that you’d see while in the theaters with four characters singing, “Let’s all go to the lobby to get ourselves a treat,” and the characters were I think two boxes of cigarettes and a bag of popcorn and a soda, and it showed them walking around and singing that, and it showed people buying stuff at the lobby.","Then it finished the song again, and there was a countdown, “3, 2, 1,” to a film starting.","First film was from Catch Me If You Can.","It started with the protagonist of the film, the guy the film’s about on To Tell the Truth, presumably afterwards, or after the events in the film take place.","Three men walk forward, all dressed the same way, in I think an air force uniform, and they all claim to be, I forget his name, I think it’s Frank William Abingard, something like that.","The middle of them, number two, is the real one, played by Matt, Leonardo DiCaprio.","The host reads out a card of what he’s done in his life, which has to do with impersonating an air marshal, pretending to be the attorney general of Louisiana, and a few other things, and he had made all this money before he was nineteen and found out.","Then the three players walk over to their chairs, and the first panelist asked number one a question.","The panelist is Kitty Carlisle.","She asks him, “Why didn’t you have a real job?” or why didn’t he choose a real job instead.","Number one, the impostor, says, “It was more important, it was a matter of dollars and cents.”","It was more important for him to just have money in the beginning.","And then she asked the real guy, number two, I forget what question she asked him.","It was “What was your first thought when you got out of prison?” or something like that.","And the real guy flashes back to when he was in prison, or it was the name of someone, the name of I think the detective or lawyer that came to help him, to get him out of prison, that makes him flash back.","Last name I think was Hamready or something like that.","It flashes back to that lawyer trying to get into the prison.","I think it was in France.","The lawyer is played by Tom Hanks, wearing a sort of like a slouch hat.","He has an umbrella, it’s raining outside, and he's fighting with officers, verbally, to try to get into the prison.","And then he's let inside, and the officer tells him to sit on a stool on the other side of a jail cell, where Frank is being held.","He looks through the grate, and Frank is destitute.","He's on the ground, hunched over in a blanket.","He's dirty and coughing.","The lawyer starts reading him the case, says that he has a cold too.","Frank falls over and faints, or at least is pretending to.","Lawyer calls for a doctor.","They rush him into the medical ward of this prison.","The lawyer says, He needs a doctor,” and the French officer says, “The doctor won’t be here until tomorrow.","He’ll be fine until then.”","The lawyer says if he loses this case because of him, that the officer, he’ll hold the officer accountable.","Suddenly they hear the door open, and the prisoner had escaped the room.","They go out to the hallway, and the prisoner is crawling on his hands and knees, trying to get away from him, but he’s sick and coughing and can’t really do it.","They catch up to him, and the officer puts a gun to his head, which makes him stop.","The prisoner says to the lawyer, “Alright, I'm ready to go home.”","The next movie was The Record, it was called.","It was animated, showed a girl sitting on a bed in her apartment, about to eat a slice of pizza, when the doorbell rings.","She goes out to see what’s outside, and there's a package.","She opens the package, and there's a record inside.","She goes back into the room, puts the record on the record player, and starts it.","The record’s called A Single Life.","She goes to take a bite of her pizza, but the record skips, and all of a sudden, the pizza has a big bite taken out of it.","So when the record skipped, it went ahead in time.","So she looks back at the pizza and the record and realizes what happened, and starts playing with the record to see, moving it ahead so she goes into the future, moving it back so she goes into the past.","She watches the candle burn down and go up, the clock travel forward and travel backwards next to her.","She moves the needle on the record much forward, and she's standing in her apartment, and she has, she's pregnant now.","She moves it forward and back, the record, and she, her belly gets bigger and smaller.","She moves it much forward, and she's holding a baby.","The baby starts to cry, so she moves the record forward again, or no, she moves the record backward I think.","She goes back in time to when she was a kid.","She goes to move the record forward again, but she can't reach it.","I think she might fall over or something, and the record skips much farther forward to where she's an older lady.","She has gray hair now and is wearing glasses, and she walks using a cane.","She goes over to move the record again, but it skips, and she goes five seconds into the past, where she's standing farther away.","She goes to move the record again, but it skips back again.","So she keeps trying to time it to where she can move it, but she doesn’t get there in time.","Finally the record skips forward a little more, and she finds herself in a walker far away from the record.","She seems a little content, but all of a sudden she realizes the record’s about to run out.","She walks toward it, but the song ends.","The needle comes off it, and all the sudden she turns into an urn of her own ashes.","Her life is ended when the song ended.","The next, the next movie was called The Boyfriend, I think.","It showed a woman sitting at the end of a table, eating dinner, and her boyfriend is at the end of that long table, also eating dinner.","She offers him a glass of wine.","He says he can't drink when he's on call.","She says, well, she thought he might, because it was their anniversary.","She gets mad at him, and says that he's a systems analyst, or a computer analyst, not a surgeon, he can have a drink.","He doesn’t acknowledge her.","He says, “The asparagus is quite tender.”","She looks at him and says, “It’s an aphrodisiac.”","He says, “Who says that?” and she says she's not sure.","So she gets mad at him when he seems disinterested in her and doesn’t want to have sex.","She screams at him, and then she walks over and apologizes and holds him.","All of a sudden she turns off a switch on the back of his neck, and it turns out that he was a robot.","So she seems to have become dissatisfied with her robot boyfriend, so she goes online and checks out the website where she can upgrade to a new one.","She finds one that she likes, and she calls in to the customer service of the company, and she works out a new boyfriend to upgrade to.","The next scene is of her getting it delivered to her door.","Two workers, two blonde women from the company who look alike, probably robots as well, come and unload this robot, which is turned off.","He looks more rugged than the last one; he has a beard and he isn’t as conservatively dressed.","She had asked for a rock climber.","They take the old robot away.","She kisses the old boyfriend and takes a wedding band off of his ring finger.","She turns on the new boyfriend, and sits back where she was at the dinner table.","He tells her the asparagus is very tender as he starts to eat it and that, he tells her that it’s an aphrodisiac.","She says, “Who says that?” He says, “I don’t know. It’s just what people say.”","She seems very interested in him, now that it’s more her type.","He gets up and walks around the table and starts to massage her shoulders, asks her about her day.","She says she went into town in the morning.","But as she's talking, he flips the switch on her neck, so that she turns off, turns out she was a robot as well.","He walks over to the couch and starts smoking a cigarette and has a drink, turns on the television.","The next movie was called The Shoe, and it starts with a picture, a shot of a shoe lying in the curb of a street, and then it pans out, and there's a man standing there.","He opens a carton of milk and starts to drink out of it.","He's leaning against a car.","The owner of the car walks up and shoos him away from leaning on it.","He starts walking.","As he's walking, as he walks onto the sidewalk, he trips a little on the curb and stumbles, but regains his balance and keeps walking.","He looks across the street.","There's a girl walking the same direction as him, and she pretends to trip and then regain her balance.","He thinks this is odd, so he does something else that she copies.","Before he does that he puts the milk down on the fence before he keeps walking.","She copies whatever he does.","Then she notices that he’s paying attention.","They smile at each other as they're walking.","So next he bends over as he's walking and like walks a weird way, and she copies him.","And then she starts dancing, bends over like that as she's walking, and he does the same thing.","But he starts walking, he's getting to a corner on the sidewalk where he's gonna cross the street, and he's not paying attention.","So she stops doing that, she gets up and starts making motions for him to stop, but he just keeps walking, while making the same motions that she's making like they're still playing that game.","She covers her mouth in fear and shock, and he does the same, and he gets hit by the car.","He goes up onto the windshield and cracks it, and he sort of flies through the air.","Car also flies through the air in slow motion.","The car lands, and then there's a shot of the shoe that’s come off of that man as he got hit that falls into the curb like the first shot of the movie.","And it pans over to another shoe, a different shoe, and then it stops.","The next film was called, I forget the name, I think it was Kevin, Kevin something.","Well anyway, Kevin is a blue stick figure.","He drives up to a building in a blue car, slowly gets out of it.","And a screen appears that says, “Kevin is,” I think “excited to go to work today.”","So he gets out of his car, goes back in, takes his hat, puts it on, closes the door and walks into work.","And a narrator says that Kevin’s excited to go to work, looking forward to going to work today, because he thinks he's going to get a promotion.","So he walks past a red stick figure on the first floor, which is the security guard.","He gets in the elevator.","He takes it up to the fourth floor, where he gets out and he hits on a woman, I think she's a pink stick figure.","When he gets out of the elevator, she's bending over, and the narrator introduces her as his love interest, even though she's not interested in him.","Everyday he offers her coffee, and even though she doesn’t want any, he gets her a cup.","And we see her, or Kevin goes back in the elevator and keeps going up a few floors.","We see her pour the coffee out the window.","She pours it on top of a guy, who was on a ladder doing work outside the window, and he falls down to the ground.","We see a guy in an office on the second floor who is seeing the guy, seeing something fall past the window.","He goes and looks and sees that it’s a guy who’s fallen down to the ground, so he calls an ambulance.","Meanwhile, Kevin’s taking the elevator up to the eighth floor, where he's looking forward to getting his promotion.","We see a green stick figure, whose name is, I think Peter Campbell.","He's walking out of the boss’s office.","He's gotten the promotion.","Kevin doesn’t know that yet, so he passes him, walks into the boss’s office.","Narrator says he was expecting a firm handshake and a promotion, but he got a weak handshake and he didn’t get the promotion.","It was given to somebody else.","Meanwhile, Peter Campbell has taken the elevator down to the fourth floor and gone and told the woman who works there that he got the promotion, and they start to kiss.","Kevin is now taking the elevator down to the fourth floor, hoping that he could console himself with her company, but as the doors open, he sees those two kissing.","He stands in the elevator for a long time, watching them, says the door has stayed open longer than normal.","Peter Campbell walks back into the elevator, asking if he could hold the door for him.","They travel up to the seventh floor, where Kevin’s office is, or where Peter’s office is.","As Peter gets out, Kevin tells him to go fuck himself, and Peter approaches him in the elevator and punches him, so that his hat falls off.","And Kevin snaps and punches him and starts beating him with his suit, with his briefcase, and he kills him in the elevator, and there's blood on the walls.","So he thinks about how he has to cover it up, and he starts dragging him out of the elevator, and he's gonna drag him down the stairs and bring him home until he can figure out what to do with him.","Then the woman who works on the second floor decides to go up and use the bathroom on the seventh floor, where the two men are.","She takes the stairs because of her New Year’s resolution, which gives Kevin time to drag Peter down the stairs to the sixth floor, but he's still on the stairs when that woman sees them.","She faints in shock and dies on the stairs.","Kevin feels bad about that but keeps going.","He makes it down to the fifth floor, where he sees a conveniently placed ladder outside that he's going to go down on.","The love interest has walked upstairs and sees them, sees them standing near the window with the dead body of her love interest on the floor, and she faints forward.","She doesn’t die, because she's not near the stairs.","Kevin thinks this is good, so maybe he can still woo her later on, and he starts pushing the body out the window onto the ladder.","The body falls down to the ground, and the ladder is sort of balanced off the building now.","Kevin’s balancing on it.","He sees a man he's never seen, I think it was a custodian on the fifth, on the fourth floor.","And he looks at him from outside the window.","That was the end of that.","The next movie was called The Rock.","It was animated, and it starts with a big mountain with a face on it.","Well before that, it starts in like a pond, and there are, it’s like in prehistoric times.","There are prehistoric fish swimming and a reptile comes out of it.","Then it pans over on the side of the pond, and there's a big mountain with a face on it, and that’s the rock, and he looks very tired.","He was asleep and woken up by this animal calling.","He looks sort of bored and tired, so he goes to, he starts sleeping, and we see time go by, and eras change in front of this mountain, so we see dinosaurs come and go extinct.","We see the ice age come and snow cover the mountain, and all the while it’s being eroded down.","And then we see the ice age come and a glacier move over it and eroded down a lot into a sort of boulder size, and the ice recedes, and vegetation grows around it.","The rock wakes up when a man climbs on top of it and cuts the tree down that has grown on top of it.","The man gets off and starts building something with the tree.","The rock takes itself up out of the ground, and walks away, trying to find a place to sleep.","So he finds a grassy hillside to sleep on, and lies down on it.","But as soon as he goes to sleep, another man sort of mines him out of the hillside and takes him away to make him into a wheel at a mill.","So he gets bared down into a circular shape, and then he's a wheel at a mill that’s constantly turning around on this pulley on the mill wheel, and he gets very dizzy.","I forget how he gets out of there, but he starts walking away or I think he kind of rolls away.","I think he might roll into the river and get washed down the river and get washed up on the shore, and he's much smaller now, parts of him keep breaking off.","I forget what he gets used as next.","Oh I think a part of him gets broken off, and he's in kind of an L shape, so an archaeologist finds him in the riverbed and dusts him off.","He turns him over, and he has a fossil on his back of a trilobite, so the archaeologist is excited and carries him away, and he puts him in a museum.","Now he's behind glass, and people are looking at him.","A kid runs up and shakes the glass, and he falls out of the perch he's been on, down the garbage chute, into a garbage bag being pushed by a janitor.","So that garbage bag gets emptied outside, and I forget how he gets there, but so he's pared down to a real small.","Oh it empties out onto a beach, so he's really small now.","He's eroded down to the little grains of sand.","So he makes a bed out of the other grains of sand, and he falls asleep, but right when he falls asleep, a bulldozer picks him up and with the sand around him brings him to a factory.","Factory he gets put on a conveyor belt and dropped into fire to cook him, and he comes out as part of a plate of glass.","So this plate of glass gets put on a rocket and becomes the front end of a telescope.","The rocket successfully launches into space, and we see the scientists at NASA applauding it.","And then its thrusters engage, and it sort of veers off course, and it ends up on what looks like the moon.","And we see time pass as the rock falls asleep again, and it turns into a big mountain just like it was at the beginning of the movie.","And it wakes up and sees what he's become and he seems pleased with it, and he exhales.","The next movie was The Prisoner, and it was a man, starts with a man in a suit, a dark grey suit, and he looks very upset, and he asks a woman near him where he is.","He doesn’t know where he is, and she keeps dodging his question.","She just says, “You're here. You're here where you live.”","So he goes to a, this big bulletin board in this village that he's unsure of where he is, and it has a bunch of numbers for things you can call, so he calls a taxi.","The taxi immediately comes up.","It’s being driven by an Asian woman, and he's a white man.","And he gets into the taxi, and he, she speaks to him in English first, and then in French.","And he speaks back in English, so she keeps talking in English.","He asked why she spoke to him in French, and she said it’s because they got a lot of people from everywhere around here.","It’s very cosmopolitan, and that she thought he was Polish or Czech at first, as well.","So he asks her to go as far as she can, and she says it’s a local taxi, so she can’t go too far, so she drives to the other side of town and lets him off there.","She asks for two units in payment.","He says he doesn’t have any, so she says he can just pay her next time and drives off.","He finds a telephone, like a payphone and tries to make a call, but the operator asks for his number, and he says he doesn’t have a number.","So she hangs up on him, so it’s implied that this guy is some sort of prisoner.","He doesn’t know how he’s gotten there, and he's trying to get out.","He walks into a general store, and the man behind the counter asked him what he wants.","He says that he's looking for a map.","He says, he gives him a black and white map, which only, it doesn’t really show the names of anything.","It just shows the town surrounded by mountains.","He says he's looking for a larger map.","He gets him a color map that’s larger in size but not in scale.","It still just shows the village and mountains around it.","All the signs for the village, including the one on the map, just says Your Village.","It doesn’t give the name of the village.","General store owner says, “You must be new around here,” and that he looks forward to his business.","Another person walks in as the prisoner walks out of the store.","The general manager owner, or the general store owner wishes him goodbye the same way the taxi driver did, which is by putting his hand to his face and saying, “Be seeing you.”","He walks out of the store.","He still looks lost and upset.","The next movie was called The Black Hole.","It opens, we see this very disheveled looking guy at an office, wearing rumpled clothing.","He seems to be the only one in the office.","He's trying to make copies, and the copier’s giving him trouble.","He hits the copier, and a page prints out that is a normal white page, but it has a big black hole in the center.","He puts that page aside and keeps trying to make copies.","He puts a cup on top of the page, and the cup falls through the black hole.","He notices what has happened, and he puts his hand near it, and he feels the pull of it, so he brings it back.","Then he carefully puts his hand through it, and he grabs the cup from the other side of the black hole and brings it back out.","So he realizes he can reach through it to like another dimension and reach through solid objects.","So he brings it over to a vending machine, puts it up against it, reaches through it, and grabs out a snickers bar.","So he unwraps the snickers bar, starts eating it, and brings the hole over to a door.","He reaches through the door through the hole, unlocks it from the other side, and goes through.","There's a safe on the other side.","He reaches, he puts it up against the side of the safe, reaches into it, and starts taking out money.","He's taking out a lot of money, but he starts to not be able to reach the money at the back of the safe, so he leans in farther and farther until he's gone completely through the hole into the safe.","Then the piece of paper with the black hole falls off the door of the safe and onto the floor, and all of the sudden we hear him knocking from inside the safe.","He can't get out, because the hole is no longer there, so he's trapped in there, and the money is sitting outside of it, so presumably he's gonna be caught as the thief.","The next movie was called Post-It Love.","It was another office worker, who looks a little less disheveled, but still unhappy.","I don’t know, it opens with him making copies, but it shows on the other side of a partition another female post-it, or office worker making copies as well, and they're very symmetrical in how they're doing things.","And they catch each other’s eye and smile at each other, but they're a little awkward.","So he goes back to his office and notices that somebody’s left… Okay.

The first clip was from Catch Me If You Can.","We start off in what looks like the stage area for a TV show, and there's a host, and he's talking, and he invites to stage three guys.","All of them are pretty young, in their late twenties, and they're wearing pilot clothes, and all of them for whatever reason are addressed to as Frank Abagnale.","I think it's some kind of TV show where you're supposed to prove that one of them is Frank, or something like that.","The guy in the middle is Leonardo DiCaprio.","Okay, so the three guys walk to the three, whatever he calls those things in Jeopardy, and they're being asked questions, ","and the first question is for the guy on the left, and this lady asks him why he did what he did, and he gives this dry, boring answer, saying he just needed the money, ","and then I think the TV show host, like the guy who's talking at the beginning, white hair, pretty old, asks Leonardo DiCaprio, who's sitting in the middle, who caught him, and he starts to remember, ","and the scene cuts back to a flashback in Marseilles, in France, where we see a guy, his name is Carl Hanratty.","He's like a policeman.","He's got this hat, and he's talking to a bunch of people, trying to get somewhere, and it's raining, it's pretty bleak out, really like dark grey weather.","He's Tom Hanks.","He walks to this, what looks like this like French maximum security prison and is like let in and finally gets to the cell of Frank Abagnale, and I think he's there to, it says he's there to like prep him for a trial, pick him up for a trial.","In any case, it becomes clear a little bit later that, from him talking to the French guys, that he's there to take him to America.","But Leonardo DiCaprio's not in very good shape.","He's coughing a lot, he's got really long hair, he's like pretty dirty, he seems to be struggling, and finally he actually, during the conversation, he faints and kind of this persuades Carl to call up the French officers and ask for a doctor.","He thinks it's an emergency, even though he was advised before not to like pass any food, kind of not to believe anything that Frank does.","They take Frank to this infirmary.","It's like Carl and Frank and maybe like five other French officers with funny hats and mustaches, and Frank gets sat on this infirmary bed.","He's the only guy there, he's coughing pretty violently, and then Carl is pretty, pretty adamant.","He really wants a doctor for this guy.","He doesn't want him to die before he gets him to America.","He seems like he's after some kind of prize, and as they talk, and they kind of argue and bicker, they sort of lose sight of Frank, and at some point they hear this door open and realize that Frank has escaped.","Then the scene cuts to Frank still coughing and walking really haphazardly through, through the prison as the other prisoners are like cheering him on, and finally he, the French officers and Carl catch up with him.","Carl kind of gives him this look like ","and the scene, the scene cuts, and that's it.","That's the first clip.","The second clip was an animation.","It opens up in this indoor scene.","We see this sort of woman, early thirties, red hair, kind of sitting around with a pizza, preparing to eat dinner.","When she hears the doorbell and receives a record, and she takes the record, puts it on her record player, starts playing for a little bit.","This like cute, peaceful song starts playing, and I think like accidentally she like pushes around the needle of the record player and realizes that when she does that, her pizza turns, ","and she does that a few more times and realizes that basically what's going on is that the needle is, as the needle moves onto the record, it's controlling time.","She moves it a little bit, she moves it up and down and notices her pizza going up and down and then the candle, the red candle that's going up and down at the same time as the pizza.","She moves it a little further and finds herself in a completely different home, much different, much tidier, kind of white, like fancy, like a fancy mirror, there's some fancy characters around.","She's maybe a little bit older, wearing some fancier clothes, and she realizes that she's pregnant and kind of feels around her belly and again like just moves the, moves the needle on the, the record player is still there, still playing the music.","She moves the needle a little bit and notices her belly expanding and contracting, and then, I'm trying to remember when it was by accident, but she, so she hits the needle one more time, ","and this time she's a little bit older, and she's actually maybe like 50 or 60.","She's got gray hair.","The scene changes again, and I don't remember where exactly she is.","She's also in a different home.","The baby's kind of gone, and she's trying to, she starts to not like this, she's trying to reach out to the needle to push it back to where it was.","She's in a cast, so her leg accidentally hits the record player, and the needle advances even further.","Now she's even older.","She's got a walking aid, one of those walking aids, I don't know what you call them in English, and she tries to, she tries to hurry to move towards the record player, ","because she realizes that the record is about to reach the end, and she doesn't get there on time, and then the record ends,","and the scene cuts again, and we see her, she's disappearing inside an urn, a purple urn with a white cross on it, so she's gone, she's dead, and I think that's where the clip ends, and the music is still playing.","Okay, now the third clip, I think, this is the one with this dysfunctional couple, so got this couple, this woman with a close camera angle talking to this guy at dinner and realizes this guy is her husband, and she is, we hear about how it's their wedding anniversary.","I guess like, they're both pretty young, they're maybe like early thirties, clearly, clearly pretty frustrated even though it's like romantic.","She has candles on and stuff.","She clearly gets more frustrated with him as the evening progresses until she basically snaps and is like, ","I don't know, she seems like she's trying to get him to do something, to say something, to make her feel something.","The scene is pretty dark, pretty gloomy like pretty blue colors, also this blue Keurig, and then what happens, oh right, he doesn't get the hint, he continues to say very lame things.","He says that the asparagus is very tender.","She still is super frustrated, so she goes towards him at some point, oh, before that though, he starts smoking.","He lights up a cigarette, she gets really angry at this and like, gets up from the table, walks towards him and takes his cigarette and is like, ","He doesn't care, he lights a second cigarette, and then finally she walks towards him and starts caressing his neck and the back of his head, ","and we, the camera cuts back to the back, and we see her fingers as she finds a button that was at the back of her husband's neck, and she turns him off basically, and he stops talking.","So we realize at this point that he's a robot, he's some sort of android, and she goes to the back, she goes to the room, and starts browsing on her Apple.","She's in her bedroom, sitting on her bed, and we see her Apple computer, and we realize that she's browsing for this android company.","She's browsing for new models of husbands that she can order.","She sort of swipes through a few and seems to decide on one and then calls the company, the 1-800 number, and she's greeted by this female voice saying like, ","Trying to remember what she says, I think she says something like, oh, hes's something like, ","and the lady on the phone says, ","She says, ","and then at some point you hear the doorbell ring.","Some time must have passed, and you see this, there's a lady from the company, and there's another lady, and they unpack from a plastic-y weird thing, they unpack the second model and replace, take away the old guy.","So the new guy comes to the table, sits in the same spot, and I think it's the wife that turns him on, using the same button in the back and picks up the conversation, saying, ","and oh right, a key point that I forgot to say from before.","She tries to, she tries to lure him into, into possibly having sex by alluding to the fact that the asparagus is a good aphrodisiac, and the guy before doesn't get the hint.","This guy, however, the new guy, says the same thing about the asparagus, ","At this point he gets up from the table and walks towards her and starts giving her a massage and asking her how her day went and this goes on for about a minute, ","until finally we see, surprise, surprise, his fingers slipping to the back of her neck and he turns her off.","It turns out she was an android as well.","He turns her off, and he gets up and sits on the couch, puts his feet up, turns the TV on, and starts watching TV, and that's the end of this pretty weird clip.","Okay, fourth clip is about, it's kind of weird.","It's called The Shoe, so the camera, the scene opens up with this close-up of a shoe, and we realize that the shoe belongs to this guy, who's standing in the street, near the sidewalk, ","and he's trying to open a milk carton to drink out of it, so we sort of like look at, we see his milk carton as he's opening it.","He manages to open it.","He looks inside, he looks inside to see whether the milk is good or something, and then he drinks it, and he seems very happy.","The camera pans out, and we see we're in some kind of suburban sunny area, and there are cars on the road, and at some point this guy catches the eye of this other girl on the other side of the street, ","and they kind of start getting into this sort of playful imitation game, where he does something funny with his hands, and she does something funny, and then they start sort of dancing in tandem and laughing.","It's all really cute and stuff, until he gets too wrapped up in the game, and to her, to her great dismay, he gets run over by a car while he's, he's not looking, so he gets run over by this car.","I think it was some sort of old 70s like reddish car, and the car doesn't manage to avoid him, and not only does it hit him, but it also skids out and hits this other car and jumps up in the air, ","and this guy, I think, is thrown in some weird way, like he hits the windshield, the windshield shatters, and all we see is this shoe jumping into the air, ","and then they have this, this sort of camera panning, showing us the trajectory of the shoe as it jumps through the air and falls onto the sidewalk, and then we get this camera move towards this other shoe, this black leathery shoe, and that's where this one ends.","Um, okay, I think that was four.","So the fifth one was the second animation in the series, and it's funny, this was like a 2D video about this guy named Keith Reynolds.","He's like this blue, slender, sinewy stick figure, and he has a hat, and he has a briefcase, and we see him as his car drives, he drives left to right because it's 2D, ","and he gets off at his office, and we learn from the narration that he is about to get promoted, or so he thinks.","He's getting amped up for this, gets prepared, and before, so he walks into the building of his work.","This is an office building, and before going upstairs to his manager, oh, before that, there's a funny line about what his status in the company is, and apparently he's the most senior junior associate at this company.","Right, so he first goes to his floor, and turns out he's officemates with this woman, I think her name is Sara, that he's been trying to woo, and we find out that he really likes her, and he often makes her coffee.","He makes her coffee this time also, but she never seems to want his coffee.","Even this time we see him giving her coffee, trying to do his usual thing, but then when he leaves, she pours the coffee out the window, like in kind of a cruel way, ","so we start feeling pretty sorry for this guy and kind of anticipate that no good can come out of this, and he, okay so he finally, like amps himself up, gets ready, like walks into the elevator and goes upstairs to get his promotion,","and we hear that he's imagining the handshake.","He's like seeing the moment unfold in front of his eyes.","Unbeknownst to him, however, this whole time upstairs there's this guy named Patrick, also slender, tall, sinewy stick figure, talking to the boss, and we learn that Patrick's doing pretty well.","He's actually being promoted himself, he's being promoted by the boss, rather than Keith, so we see Keith going up to the office as Patrick is walking out.","Keith walks into the office and has this interaction with his boss and tries to look for the, look for the contract or something, but it's clear that he's not gonna get promoted, so he gets this news, he's pretty bummed, ","and he gets back in the elevator, goes downstairs and walks in on Sara, the girl he was into, making out with this guy, Patrick, who just got a promotion, so basically Patrick ends up getting everything that Keith ever wanted,","and he sort of stands there for a second, trying to process.","Of course like, Patrick has no idea that, what's going through this guy's head.","He walks into the elevator, and they, he and Keith are in the elevator, and Keith can see Patrick's reflection in the elevator door, like looking super confident, super happy with what just happened, ","and I forget exactly why they start fighting, but, oh right, so I think Keith said some sort of profanity, swears at Patrick in some way, and Patrick gets really offended and punches Keith in the face, and they start, they start fighting, ","and you see all, you see this animated blood is spurted all over the walls of the elevator, and at some point, Keith realizes that actually, he actually killed Patrick.","He actually kills him by taking the briefcase and sort of smashing it, smashing it over his, over Patrick's head, and so that's a bummer.","Now he needs to figure out how to, how to get rid of this body, `cause he realizes that people will probably frown upon murder, people don't like murderers, according to the narrator, so Keith takes, starts carrying Patrick's body down the stairs.","Patrick's really heavy, this is really hard,","and I think, oh, there was something in the beginning I forgot to mention.","I didn't get quite how this fit in, but the guy downstairs at human resources sees someone, sees some body fall out the window or something like that, I wasn't sure what was up with that.","Anyway, but back to Keith and Patrick, so Keith is sort of carrying Patrick down the stairs, ","but then there's this, there's this lady who works downstairs, who decides to take a break, goes up the stairs, runs into Keith as he's trying to carry Patrick out and basically like faints at the sight of them.","At this point, Keith decides it's probably a bad plan to try to carry Patrick all the way downstairs, so he tries to carry him to his office and out the window onto this service ladder.","I don't remember exactly how, but Sara also ends up seeing them one more time and fainting as well.","Keith has a revelation that yeah, probably this is how some women react to dead bodies, they just kind of faint.","All right, so he tries to carry Patrick out the window, and I think, let's see, I'm going blank here, I think he probably, I think he dies himself.","He manages to carry this guy, but then as he climbs the ladder, he like, I think the movie ends on him probably falling off the ladder as well.","So that was a pretty bleak, pretty bleak animation.","So we have that.","Okay, cool, I think that's all for the first half.","The second half, the first one is also an animation.","This one's super cute.","It's about a rock, so we see this big rock, it's stylized, it has only eyes and a nose, and it's not quite a rock, it's more like, more like a mountain, ","and we see it as it looks around it and witnesses the, witnesses this little aquatic creature crawling onto, onto the earth.","It's witnessing when the amphibians first got out of the water and became reptiles basically, and so we see the rock witnessing this, and the camera cuts to, to the time when there were dinosaurs, so we see a bunch of dinosaurs running around.","There's a stegosaurus, a T-Rex, everything really lush with green.","Then, I'm trying to remember how we end up, I'm blanking a little bit, but at some point, this rock ends up in a forest.","It looks like it's much closer to contemporary times, it's kind of a, like, it has, leaves are pretty red, so must be fall time.","There are animals around, and there are humans, there are workers in the forest, and this rock is like, it gets really sleepy and tries to go to sleep, but gets, gets, so these workers basically start to, how do I say this, I wish I was more bilingual, ","okay, so these rock workers try to extract the rock, and they take her, and they basically turn her into a, into a mill rock, one of these things that you use to, to extract water from a mill.","A millstone is what it's called, and still like this rock is kind of alive, and we see her persona.","We see her like kind of yawning and witnessing all these things, and then, something, something fun happens, fun, unexpected.","We see these, these Yankee, what looks like Yankee soldiers busting into these, into this mill, and we realize that we're sometime, this is happening sometime during the American Civil War, and these soldiers attack, attack the mill.","There's a bit of, there's a fight, and they keep the rock, and they smash it to pieces, and they turn it into a, into a cannonball.","Rock's still alive and now is a cannonball, and we see it as it flies out of, of this cannonball.","There's a naval battle going on, and it flies and hits this other ship.","Where does it end up next?","I think it falls, I don't remember exactly where it falls, but I remember at some point she ends up in a forest, where she gets picked up by this Darwin-looking explorer guy, scientist guy, who sees it and gets super excited, ","because it turns out that there's a trilobite fossil on the other side of the rock, so he takes the rock and adds it to his collection, makes some notes and presents her at some expo, at some museum.","This museum, we learn it's in Paris, how do we learn it's in Paris?","Oh, it's because of, right, at this museum everyone's taking photos, there's lots of flashes and this sort of like rock is confused about everything that's going on, ","and she gets really startled when this horrendous looking boy, who reminds me of Darla from, from Finding Nemo, makes faces at the window,","so, where she was, so the rock was in the window, she's like in this exhibit, and when this boy basically, how do I say this, like kind of like shows his face and startles the rock, ","she falls backwards and somehow manages to fall through the pipes and ends up, ends up on the sidewalk, is being kicked around by this French young dude with a hat.","He's sort of whistling and singing.","This is Paris at night, we hear some French music playing in the background, and he picks up the rock and throws it at a window, and we realize it's probably his lover he's trying to get, ","or he's throwing it at some random window, who knows, but I interpret it as he threw this rock at this window to get the attention of his lover, who's having dinner with this, with this other guy.","And I'm blanking on what happened in between, but the rock, the rock finally ends up on a beach.","It's really small at this point, so it started out as a big mountain.","Now it's small, it has this kind of funny shape, and it's sort of early morning, we see this big bulldozer carrying and picking up a bunch of sand, together with the rock, ","and it, the rock basically ends up in this glass-making factory, and we see it, together with other rocks, just kind of confused still, but she's together with other rocks like her on this assembly line, again like movie references reminding me of Toy Story,","and she finally falls into this pit, this like cauldron where she gets melted and turned into, turned into sand and glass, and then finally she gets, she gets her moment of glory.","She gets turned into, she gets turned into glass and gets slapped on, on top of this space telescope, and this telescope gets launched into, into the atmosphere and takes awesome, awesome photos of both galaxies far far away.","However, at some point this mission, this mission goes wrong, and this telescope shatters among a bunch of asteroids and stars and somehow the pieces of glass turn out the rock on a planet that looks like Saturn, ","and we cut back to later on when the rock, like after much much, like after a long time passes, again becomes a mountain like we saw at the beginning.","We see the same kind of scene, she's very sleepy, wakes up, stares at the puddle of water in front of her, sort of like nice circular thing.","Okay, that was the first one of the second half.","Then we have the second one which is about the prisoner, so this was weird, and I don't remember very well, but I'll try.","So this guy, who's a forty or fifty-year-old guy, seems very put together, very sharp, ends up in this village that looks like the Wizard of Oz, and he has these sort of like funny, funny interactions.","At first, he meets this old woman, doesn't quite manage to figure out where he is, trying to figure out where he is, ","and then he asks where he can make a phone call, and he's directed by the woman to get out and turn the corner, where he'll find a phone booth.","At the phone booth, he manages to call a taxi company, and the taxi company turns out, sends this lady, taxi driver in this kind of like, maybe motorized, maybe not, rickshaw type thing.","This lady's, she's Asian, she's wearing a funny sort of like white doctor's hat and white, white red stripy shirt.","She's wearing a little bit of makeup, and this guy, the, he's trying to ask her if, ","and she actually answers that, ","So she sort of shows him around and finally drops him off at what

more like end of the century, so he doesn't seem to be, ","he seems to be quite out of place there, and he gets in the store, and he talks to the store owner, ","and they have some conversation I can't remember, and then this guy asks for, asks for a map, and then the store owner is like, ","He pulls out this cartoonish looking map, and our guy, the main character, he's kind of distressed.","He's like, ","The reason he's distressed is because the map shows this village, it's marked The Village on the map, and you see that the village is surrounded from all sides by mountains and water, so there seems to be like basically no way to get out of there.","He's like, ","and the store owner says, ","It is even bigger, it is more colorful, it has more detail inside about the village and about the different buildings, but still there's nothing, no information about the surrounding areas, shows only the mountains and the water, so this guy's kind of distressed, leaves the store.","That's about all I remember from this one.","That's number two, I think I have three more to go here.","Oh man, they're starting to blur a little in my head.","Ah yes, okay so there's a cutesy one, doesn't have much of a story, but it was still pretty cute, about, oh okay I remember, because they're both about offices, cool.","So the one about post-it love is about two people, a guy and a girl, who work in the same office, big, sunny office,  ","and they meet at the printer, and they sort of meet each other's eyes and fall for each other, have a little crush on each other, and they're both sort of shy. He seems to be pretty shy,","and they, how does it go?","So this guy returns to, returns to his desk, and he opens a folder and notices this smiley face made of blue post-its and realizes that it was probably made by the girl that he met at the printer.","He's kind of happy and satisfied and leans back and realizes at the same time he's leaning back that she was leaning back, so they kind of catch each other's eye, and it's super cute, and then the scene cuts to her.","She goes back to her office.","For whatever reason, she has a slightly nicer office.","It's upstairs, and it seems to be in

so I'm gonna start again, so I left off at a clip with two guys who communicate through post-its, ","so she just got back to her office upstairs and I think opens a window or opens a cabinet door and finds this cute sun made out of yellow post-its and realizes that it was this, ","the guy that she met at the printer that she left the blue post-it smiley face for, and that's really cute.","I forget if there's any other exchanges in between, but then we cut to her, to the girl going to the supply room and, at the office, and she sort of rummages through the supply room and gets, gathers all of the post-it decks that she can find.","We assume that she's doing that to kind of have, to make something bigger and greater than before.","So she takes all of these, she can barely carry them, walks out of the supply room, and as she walks out from the supply room, we see the camera sort of panning out, ","and in front of her is this entire wall-sized artwork made of post-its that shows the guy and her,","just the heads and maybe like some clouds or some sun or some sky stuff above, but it's just sort of heads like leaning against each other and sort of smiling in a cute way, ","and then we see the guy kind of crouch down and putting the finishing touches and sticking more post-its to this artwork, and she's obviously like super surprised and happy to happen to see this, ","and he kind of turns around and smiles like, ","This is where this one ends.","I think this was, the clip before was the Black Hole one, also in an office, so very different atmosphere.","It's kind of late at night, and the light is off.","You see this guy, like clearly like pretty frustrated, working late, and he's at the printer printing something out, and what he prints is this sort of like large size, like not what he wanted, ","like this large size picture of just a giant black circle, and he takes it out, takes it out from the printer, and kind of does other stuff with the printer,","but then he sort of frustratingly throws his coffee cup, puts his coffee cup on the table where this picture is that he had laid down before, and he notices the coffee cup basically disappears inside this black circle.","He's obviously very confused about what's going on and kind of tentatively tries to put his hand in.","You can hear this sort of distinct, distinct wheezing noise, sounds like something out of Star Wars, sounds like there's something weird and supernatural about this print.","He has the idea of, well after he puts his hand inside this, this hole, this hole made by this black circle, he has the idea to go to the vending machine and to press the print against the vending machine, ","and he puts his hand through it and realizes that he can actually take out all of the, all of the, he can take out the candy.","So this circle has the property that wherever you put it, it basically removes all the obstacles between, between you and whatever thing was behind the obstacle.","So he gets kind of greedy, he takes out all of these Snickers bars.","He's kind of a weird guy, and he starts sort of snarfing down this Snickers bars, and then we see this sort of mischievous light come onto his face.","He goes to a door left of the office.","He places the, the print against the door, opens the door, we realize this door was locked, and then behind the door we see a safe, so we realize he's trying to go steal money.","He's probably working in some kind of a bank or insurance office or something.","He places the print against the safe door and starts pulling out, puts his hand through and starts pulling out wads of cash, more and more wads of cash, but then he again gets super greedy just like he did with the, with the candy, ","and he kind of puts his hand too far away, and he accidentally, he falls inside the safe, and he falls with his entire body, and he can't get out, and because he's not holding the print anymore, we see the print, this hole is falling down to the floor, ","so the portal between the safe and the outside has disappeared, and he gets locked in the safe.","Then the camera pans out, and we just hear him kind of like desperately hitting, hitting the safe walls, but he's now locked inside the safe, and I think that's where the clip ends.","Okay, and I think there's one more left, definitely the weirdest one of all.","So we're at this bus stop in what looks like Central New Jersey, based on the fact that we see New York in the background and the Freedom Tower, and we see this guy, and he's listening to music.","He's wearing like white headphones.","It's very warm outside, he's pretty sweaty, and he has a bag that we realize is full of strawberry ice cream that's kind of melting, ","and as he's waiting for his bus, there's no one else around except that this black SUV pulls over on the other side of the road, ","and we see the door open, and there's this woman who walks out of the SUV with curly red hair and wearing these like tights and kind of like floral coats and I think high heels, ","and she walks out of the car, looks kind of frustrated, walks around for a little bit.","This guy that, just observes her as she, as she paces around.","She's obviously pretty distressed, she forgets to put on the brake, the handbrake, so the car kind of starts spinning with the door open.","She doesn't seem to care about that.","She makes her way towards our guy, who's waiting at the bus stop and asks to use his cell phone.","He's like, ","She's really angry with whoever, to whoever's she's talking to.","I think she's asking, she says something like, ","and then at the end of the conversation, she smashes the phone to the ground, to this guy's dismay and surprise, and he's obviously too tired, too hot to argue with her, ","but he's like, ","She doesn't seem to care, and then the camera pans over to, to this bridge that we realize is nearby, and we see a car approaching, and the car stops, and out of the car walks this guy, walks out this guy, tall guy, a little bit bald.","He looks like he's wearing a suit, maybe suspenders, white shirt, and he's got this long face, big bulgy eyes.","He's kind of funny looking, clearly knows the woman.","The woman starts talking to him, and he seems to be the guy that she was calling.","He's trying to be apologetic, but then he gets really angry when he realizes that the woman told this guy at the bus stop, who was just observing the whole thing, who he was.","We learn about him that he was a magician or something, or the guy at the bus stop recognizes him as the magician at the casino, and then things get really weird.","For whatever reason, this magician guy, oh so I should say this, the lady like keeps asking him, ","We don't know who she is, but at this point, she, so we focus on the magician, trying to remember when, I think the lady first pulls a gun out, pulls a gun on the magician, and the magician also pulls a gun on her.","He kind of makes this magic trick happen, pulls out this small, what looks like a toy gun but is probably a real gun, and then the guy at the bus stop, who is still observing this whole thing, is obviously very confused.","We see this image of him just kind of standing between the two of them as they point guns at each other, and then the lady starts walking towards the car.","The magician pulls out some kind of box and starts talking to the, to the guy at the bus stop and tries to basically pull some magic trick on him.","It's not, I'm trying to remember exactly what he does, but he says some words, sound like an incantation, opens the box, and in the box, as he does this, ","we sort of have this weird angle where he's above, he's standing above the guy at the bus stop, and the guy at the bus stop gets more and more confused.","We don't see exactly what happens to him, but we see what he sees, which is this box with this skin of something, maybe like the skin or this fossil or some sort of weird object that looks like a human in a fetal position.","I don't know exactly what it was, can't pinpoint it, and we cut out of that scene, or we're still in the same scene, ","but we cut out to the lady, and the lady goes to the car, opens the trunk, and in the trunk finds something or someone that gets her really, really upset,","and she walks away from the trunk with her gun and points the gun at the magician, and the magician's like, ","and the magician, with kind of his last breath, he collapses on the pavement, like clearly he's bleeding, he's gonna die soon, but he manages to pull out his own little gun and shoots the woman, and yeah so they're both dead, ","and we finally get to see what happened to the poor guy at the bus stop, and we realize that what happened to him, he's basically led to believe, or turned into a dog.","He's still human, but he barks, and he walks on his, on his all fours, and he starts walking toward the car, barking and acting like a dog, ","and out of the trunk comes this young woman, this like young, brunette woman we can only assume is the woman that the now dead red-headed woman was talking about on the phone, and she's barking as well, so she's also acting like a dog.","She and the guy at the bus stop are now dogs, or think of themselves as dogs and start kind of sniffing each other,","and then we just see them both walking on all of their, walking on their all fours, heading out, heading out into the sunlight of the great New York City skyline, and that's about it for this one.","I'm trying to remember.","I think, I think I got all of them, yeah.","Yeah, I think that's all that I can remember for now."],"duration":{"_EnumKey_":[10,17,8,18,7,12,14,13,3,9,4,16,15,5,19,22,11,6,23,20,2],"_EnumValue_":{"_ArraySize_":72,"_ArrayType_":"uint8","_ArrayZipType_":"zlib","_ArrayZipSize_":72,"_ArrayZipData_":"eJwNyVsWgCAIBcAD6hV5GVb732rN7xC3PgBMWWoeocIjbOa2i5ukW/2ftPRkybnLWkGfoh40Fe7A\nVn7NPlqOAq0=\n"}}}}},

she puts it on and then she realizes as it's going that the pizza starts going away, before she can even, before she even bites any of it.","And then she sort of backtracks in the record and realizes that the record is sort of ticking away along with her life, and so it's kind of like going forward in time with the pizza being eaten.","And so she zooms forward a little bit and then realizes the whole pizza's gone.","And then she starts experimenting and she starts like, she ticks further forward in time and she notices that she's pregnant, and then starts playing around with the record again and it like sort of moves her stomach in and out to go along with the baby's growth.","And then she jumps forward a little bit further, and then to a baby pops out.","And then she starts skipping even further in time so I think she next goes into her childhood, she skips back on the record, ","and then from there she actually skips towards the end of her life, towards the very, one of the last moments and she realizes that she, she tries to get to the record from her chair, ","and she realizes she can't, but she tries a few times but keeps skipping back, but she manages to get it close enough to skip it forward once again, and then she goes, it looks like she's in a nursing home,","and then she tries to get to the record to like kind of skip it backwards because she realizes she's about to die, and then she doesn't get there in time, and that's how that one ends.","I'll go to the next one, um, Keith Reynolds?","So Keith Reynolds is this like, is this like businessman-type guy.","It starts with the words, I think ","He walks into the office, and then describes how he's been in love with this girl on the fourth floor, and he's expecting, oh, just to backtrack a little;

Something like that.","And one of them, the middle one is Leo DiCaprio, and then there's a voiceover kind of explaining this guy's life, about how he has sort of just gone in and out being caught in various places---","or sorry he's just like a huge fraud, he's got like, made fraudulent behavior in like 30 different countries, 26 out of 50 countries or something, I don't know why I remember those numbers, probably wrong.","And then we go into uh, there's like a flashback or a flash-forward or like a flash somewhere to this clip in Germany where Tom Hanks is some sort of inspector, being asked to go interview him or just see what he's up to in some way","I didn't actually see this movie.","Um and so he's led into the prison and then he is shown the little flap where you can talk to Leo DiCaprio, and he opens it up but he realizes that Leo DiCaprio is not doing very well and then sort of collapses, ","and then he calls for a doctor, and then they get a group of people to carry him to a bed, a hospital bed.","But it turns out that the hospital bed, or the doctor is not in and won't be in until the next day.","And then we see a clip of Leo DiCaprio trying to escape through the prison, and then getting caught by the guards, ","and then there's like tons of different, tons of prisoners cheering, I don't know, making a lot of noise, cheering for his escape but he doesn't like make it.","Um, that's what I got for that one.","Um let's see, there's one called the Prisoner.","The one called The Boyfriend.","Uh, yeah, this is a cool clip.","So, there's a scene with a man and a woman and it seems to be some sort of romantic dinner.","And the woman is like asking him about his wine and tries to go pour him some wine, and the man refuses.","And she tries to get him to loosen up, she mentions that it's their anniversary, but he says that he's got like stuff the next day, something to get up for the next morning.","Oh but, and then she said that uh, she compliments the asparagus and she says that it's an aphrodisiac, or she says that people say that it's an aphrodisiac and I think he says, oh, what people?","And she says, I don't know, like people, like you know, they, like it's a thing people say.","And he is like generally very un, uncommunicative.","And at some point she says like oh I wanted a, you're a computer analyst, not a surgeon, or something.","And then she goes over to him, this is a little bit out of order, ","but she comes over to him and says like, I don't know, she says something else like, like um, oh, like, all I want is like some, ","yeah, if I'm lucky I'll get some mechanical sex or something later.","And he, and then she goes over to him to apologize and say she didn't mean that but then she, there's a switch behind his neck, that she flips, and actually it turns him off, so he seems to be some sort of robot.","And then the next thing we see is like he's still lying there with his head forward like lifeless and she is on the computer looking for a new robot to buy","and she makes a call to ask to say like that oh this series, her boyfriend is like not, is not doing it for her, and she is looking for a new one, so she upgrades and then they like acknowledge oh yeah like the 100 series can get like that or something.","And so she asks for um, a new one that's a masseuse and a, what a lumberjack or something?","And then she goes in, and as they're showing her the new guy, they actually bring in the old guy and they start wheeling him away and she goes in and gives him a final kiss before he leaves.","And then she comes over and then flip the new guy on and then you know they go back.","And then you see them at home, and they're having a very similar scene as the one, ","oh yeah so she also takes the ring off the old guy and puts it on the new one.","Um and they show the new scene of them talking and at first it starts the same, he refuses wine, 'cause he has to go somewhere later the next day, ","but then he brings up the asparagus and how it's good and then he mentions that it's an aphrodisiac and she questions like who says that and he says, oh you know, they.","And then the great, he comes over and starts massaging her, and it seems like oh yeah, this is like a much better boyfriend, and all of this is perfect, and stuff.","And then the great ironic switch is that he actually flips her off, she apparently has one of these things too.","So we didn't see that coming because we thought she was a human and looking for other robots, but apparently they're all robots.","And then he switches her off and then goes and watches sports and lights a cigarette.","Oh yeah and I should say that at some point the previous boyfriend had lit a cigarette and she asked, she first like took it and threw it out, and then he lit another one.","And so clearly they were not getting along.","Okay, I think that's good for that clip.","Then there was a clip called the Prisoner, what seemed to be an older clip, ","where this guy was in this town, he was trying to make a call, he seemed to be lost.","And the woman that he's talking to in this sort of restaurant-type area points him in the direction of a phone.","He picks up a phone; it's not really a phone booth, it's just like a stray big phone, like they would have in the mobile phones in the, not quite mobile, but like the phones you could carry around in your house that are kind of clunky and big.","Picks up and tries to make a call, but the operator requires a number from him, like to reach him at.","And so he is, uh, ","he says he didn't know the number so he couldn't make the call.","Someone drives by, and he jumps in and says, and he asks, it's a woman, an Asian woman on a golf cart, and she, he basically asks to take him as far away as possible.","It is a golf cart or a real car? I don't remember.","Take him as far away as she could.","And so she just doesn't take him that far, it's like basically within the same town.","And she, and they have a short conversation about the town and how it's very cosmopolitan; and she speaks, she mentions something in French and he says they're also Poles and Czechs there.","He gets out of the car and then he goes into like a shop with a map, and he asks for a map, and all that the maps has on it is like the stuff within the town, and it's got like mountains but it's basically just the town itself.","So he asks for a bigger map, and of course he's given a map in color this time, and it opens up and it's like bigger but it's actually just  a more detailed map of the same area.","And he asks for a map of, that has a wider area and it didn't seem like there were able to oblige him in that.","So it seems like he's kind of stuck in this little town.","Ok, I'm going to go to another clip, called the Rock.","So in this clip we are just following like a rock along as he sort of changes sizes and forms.","So the rock starts as just like a pair of eyes and nose on top of a, as like a whole mountain.","In like prehistoric times, you like see a little prehistoric fish come up and like look at it and like go back.","It's actually not really a fish, more like a salamander, an amphibious thing.","And then he, and then you see, there's like sort of a jumping around in time, where we see him like change forms, you know the mountain like becomes under water or whatever, gets ground down to like the size of like a boulder.","And then there's like a tree on top of the boulder, and then there's like this grass, so like maybe closer to I don't know,","maybe more modern times and then yeah it is modern times because someone is cutting down a branch of the tree with a saw, an electric saw.","And then that falls on him and then he sort of grows legs of some sort, he is able to walk around and walk away, but then gets caught, and then, how does he get caught, I don't remember.","He eventually becomes like a wheel, a wheel that's used in machinery to like churn things out, and then sort of gets ground down from there.","At some point it becomes like, about the size of a foot and is found by a paleontologist.","It looks like it has a, some sort of trilobite fossil on the bottom of it, so the paleontologist is all excited, picks it up, and puts it in a little box.","And then he's on display for a while, and then he grounds down smaller.","It's in some sort of city setting and gets thrown through the window where there's couples having dinner and then comes out the other side, and then gets ground down further. ","um,","um, yeah, he's like sort of run over by this like, by a steam roller, and then he becomes very small, gets picked up, and um,","it's eventually deposited near a beach, and then is picked up by like a big lift that is depositing minerals to be some sort of refinery.","And then it's like molten stuff, and then eventually goes back to being a mountain again.","So it's a huge circle of life with the rocks and stuff.","Um cool, what is another clip.","Janice I can't, I think I'm missing a clip but can't think of what it is, so, I guess I'm done for now."],"duration":{"_EnumKey_":[5,3,10,15,14,7,20,8,18,17,11,12,13,16,9,19,25,6,4,27,2,21,24],"_EnumValue_":{"_ArraySize_":140,"_ArrayType_":"uint8","_ArrayZipType_":"zlib","_ArrayZipSize_":140,"_ArrayZipData_":"eJwNyUEOwyAMBECtjReDMaTQpP//aSPNbSCqxVjprQehI/M1e+tljVJTIxrkimX8lMXtMfse18x5\nRBRXfu9HXQPnFr7ptB2c7bdsA6bmjiVnn2WKbSIYdaQgnKjMZ0R64Uwe8A9hMgUP\n"}}}}},

umm, so I’m going to start with the last one that I saw, which um is called The Bus Stop.","And there was a young dude standing at a bus stop with what looked like a gallon or a half-gallon of double strawberry ice cream ","and it seems like a hot summer's day cuz it was melting fast and he was just waiting there in a very deserted corner for this bus.","All of a sudden, this black SUV cruises into the frame and um this lady wearing um kind of what looks like night clothes, kind of like a night robe comes out and is looking pretty stressed out and um goes to the payphone.","Um she seems to be in a hurry because she left her driver’s door um open and she doesn’t have any quarters or is not able to make the call using the payphone um, ","so does some mild abuse to the payphone and then um notices the guy standing at the corner of the bus stop and asks him if she can borrow his phone, assuring him that she won’t take it.","He hands it to her and she redials the number while she walks away and starts saying these things about how she’ll go to the police and she says that she’s here, she’s arrived.","Um and then it seems like the other person has hung up at some point, um after that threat to go to the police, and then she smashes the phone on the ground, which startles the guy a bit more.","Um he’s just trying to do a favor for this lady.","And then he follows her because he’s wondering if he can at least get 60 bucks or something for the phone, because it’s clearly broken now.","And she pretends not to hear him, or she’s just really, seems really focused on what’s bothering her.","And then what comes into view is this man behind a steering wheel who pulls in, he’s in front of them, a few hundred feet away.","And he comes out.","And then she approaches the man who just stepped out.","Clearly this was the meeting point and um he comes out and she asks him where her sister is, and he um anyway, he comes out and then asks her um who this other person is, and this is the guy with the broken phone.","He’s like I don’t know her, um, you know he tries to explain how she broke his phone and so on.","In any case, uh, he accuses the lady of telling the ice cream guy um who he is, and suddenly the ice cream, I’m going to call him the ice cream guy, um, realizes oh!","You’re the stage magician, and you’re his assistant.","And they both pull out guns being the magician and the assistant, the lady.","Um and now ice cream guy is super freaked out, um.","Then the magician starts to, starts some incantation, which is like a this weird uh coffin like small version of a coffin and a handkerchief and um starts saying words and then the guy seems to pass out and then faint and fall.","And then um and then the woman opens the trunk and is really aghast by what she sees, although we don’t get to see what she sees just yet.","Um and then she comes over with a gun, she shoots him.","The magician on the ground shoots her.","They’re both dead.","The guy wakes up, starts licking the melted ice cream.","He is now barking like a dog.","He is now barking at some other barking, and the barking continues.","Turns out the other barking is probably from the sister that was in the trunk.","And now they are, I think they are dogs, and they’re barking, and then they leave.","Okay that was one.","Another one is um about a rock, which is this mountain.","And it starts in prehistoric times, pre pre pre pre I don’t know pre Cambrian, like early early earth times.","Um and it’s very sleepy, so it decides to close its eyes and take a nap.","You see all this fun critters around it like the ones that are fossilized today as they I guess must have been these funky frogs and trilobites and so on.","And as he’s sleeping, um the landscape around him changes.","You see um an ice age occur and through erosion and various other kind of um tectonic changes, the rock has now kind of, sort of keeled over and sort of eroded a bit to become like more of a boulder.","And then he wakes up and then thus begins a series of very disruptive encounters with animals and mostly humans, like there’s some wood choppers that start hacking away nearby, hacking a tree that’s growing on top of him.","He finds, he’s super annoyed by this because it’s so noisy, so he gets up and walks into a forest and then um decides to find a spot to take a rest.","And then as soon as he lies down and closes his eyes again, this anthropomorphized rock, um people come and wheel him away, and then grind him down, he sort of becomes like a mill stone, um, and so he’s like that for a while.","And then um then there’s like soldiers who storm into that mill house, take him, and then grind him down into a cannon ball.","So he’s like in the military for a while.","Um and then as a cannon ball he like bursts through some mast of some ship I guess and then falls to the water and is passing along and then um is a bit small now.","And then um another encounter is what looks like an archeologist identifies like a fossilized imprint of like a trilobite-ish looking thing on his back, and then so he goes to become an exhibit at the museum of natural history of some kind.","And then there’s some obnoxious child that startles him by pressing his face against the glass and so the rock falls back and then somehow ends up flying through some hidden chute system at the museum into a trash can um.","And then that’s thrown out.","Now um yeah, so, so you know, lots has changed, he’s like a rock now that can get kicked and thrown.","He’s like thrown through a window at some point.","Um, kicked around in the streets, steam rolls.","Eventually he ends up on a beach as a grain of sand essentially.","He’s like whoa, maybe now I can chill out and take a nap.","And then all of a sudden as he closes his eyes, a big scoop comes and pulls him out again.","Um and then he’s like poured into a furnace with other grains of sand.","You might think that that’s the end, but it’s not because now he is a shiny lens, or something for a telescope that is being launched into space.","Um but I think there was some kind of accident and then one of the solar panels got broken by an asteroid and so he like crash lands on this other planet.

Yeah.","He’s in this cafe area and asks a woman server um you know where he is?","And she says that he’s in the village.","And then she observes that he must not be from around here.","And then um he tries to ask for more specific information, but then she doesn’t give that, so he asks where the nearest phone is.","And then she’s like, well we don’t have a phone, um but there’s a phone box around the corner","and then the operator requires that he have a number in order to make a call, and so he doesn’t have a number, so he’s unable to make a call.","Um and then he’s walking through town, and um there’s like a visitor center kiosk thing, pushes a button for a taxi, and then immediately a taxi appears, where a woman pulls up.","And because it’s kind of an old-timey movie, I guess I was a little bit surprised that they cast like an Asian woman as this taxi driver in this like old-timey western movie in which um ","she’s wearing all stripes and then she um greets him French, and then switches to English.","He asks her why she started in French, and she says well it’s the common language, um and she says that I thought maybe you were um Polish or Czech.","Um why would you think that, well she responds because the village is you know very cosmopolitan, you never know who you might meet.","Um and you know she also mentions that this is only a local service, she can’t actually take him beyond the village, um and he just asks her to take him as far as possible.","And they arrive as far as she can go, and then she requests payment of two units.","Two units?","Two credit units.","And then his bewildered expression.","He tells her like well you know he doesn’t know what’s going on so she just smiles and says that he can pay her next time.","She drives off.","He’s walking around and then he goes to a general store, where there’s a woman picking up some groceries, and then the grocer um asks the woman to help herself to a pineapple, which she then does, and then she takes her shopping, and leaves the store.","And he has this like particular way of um saying goodbye to customers.","Um and then um he asks the man, you know what he can do for him, and the man asks for a map, the map of the area.","And the man says black and white or color?","And then man says, it doesn’t matter, just a map.","So the grocer um, the general store manager, he gets a black and white map out and then as the man rushes to open it up,","he notices that like it's the way that a map would be labeled if it were a made up fantasy game world, like um very, very provincial, generic labels, for everything.","Like the mountains, the mountains, the mountains, is how all the mountains are labeled.","The village and lawn, like there’s a lawn in the village and it’s just labeled lawn.","Um and the man asks for maybe a larger map.","And then the man, um and then the grocer um general store manager brings out the color map, and it is indeed larger.","There’s more paper involved, and it’s in color, but it’s basically the same.","It depicts the same area.","And then the man asks for a map that covers more area and then the general store manager says that that's not possible, they’re just not in demand, there’s only a map of the village.","And the man walks out um.","And yeah he seems to be trapped in this village.","And then there’s a um I think it was entitled, Catch me if you can?","Um and this one stars Leonardo di Caprio and Tom Hanks.","It comes out with the scene from like a game show with three men who all profess to be the same man, um but clearly only one of them is.","And then the game show host tells the story of the assorted past of criminal acts and wrongdoing that this man in this military uniform had committed in this previous life and then they all take their seats.","And then some kind of judge starts asking them questions, presumably to get more information about which of the three men is actually Abignail.","And um she gets to the second man, who happens to be Leonardo di Caprio’s character, and he answers a question about whether, um you know who finally caught him.","And it’s the Tom Hanks’ character, I don’t remember the name.","And we cut to Marseilles, France, I guess the day that he’s tracked down finally.","And Tom Hanks is trying to communicate with the French authorities for holding Leonardo di Caprio’s character in confinement.","And um uh Tom Hank is granted access to speak to di Caprio um who is like clearly in bad shape, coughing, terrible cough, very ragged.","He’s very ill.","And um, Tom Hanks starts to read from the declaration of human rights, and there’s a lot to get through.","But then all of sudden Leonardo di Caprio keels over and then is unresponsive, so Tom Hanks’ character shouts for a doctor, that he needs a doctor.","And then they bring him over um to the, they bring over di Caprio to like the hospital ward, whereupon the police, the French authorities wash their hands, and Tom Hanks demands that the doctor come, and the French authorities reply that the doctor will come tomorrow.","And then Tom Hanks says, well if he dies here, I’m holding you responsible.","And they turn back and then the bed is empty.","So di Caprio must have made a run for it.","And um all the prisoners are hitting the rails because they you know, there's supposed to be, there’s like a break, someone might be free, gone free.","And then di Caprio he’s running, he’s running, he’s running, he’s slowing down, he’s coughing, he’s on his knees, he’s crawling, he’s coughing.","Finally like the whole entourage of un-imprisoned people show up and they go and catch up to him.","And French authority personel person holds a gun to his head, so di Caprio stops, and then flips over and then says to the Tom Hanks character, “All right, let’s go home,” where I guess he’s gonna face charges.","There’s one called Keith Reynolds.","Um so it’s part of an animated cartoonish one, Keith Reynolds, it’s all sort of kind of comic strip-y, cartoonish feel.","Um he’s this like blue figure, who he’s walking into work, and he’s super confident because today is promotion day.","He’s been working, he's the most senior junior person analyst or something like that in the firm, so he’s pretty sure that this year’s his year, he’s going to be promoted and then when he’s promoted, this woman Sarah that he has a crush on, will finally like him.","And then we’re introduced to various other people in the office building.","Um he always offers Sarah a cup of coffee, which she never wants.","This is all told through a voiceover.","Um and then she dumps the coffee out, which um lands on like a window washer who falls off, and then somebody on another floor notices that someone’s just falling, and calls for an ambulance.","And in any case, Keith Reynolds is um in the elevator where he sees the reflection on the shiny inside surface of the elevator, riding up to where he’s gonna chat with his boss.","And then Patrick Reynolds, who we learn is his rival, has just come from that, and is feeling pretty good, because he’s heard some good news.","And then Patrick Reynolds is heading down to tell his special someone, Sarah.","And then Keith Reynolds goes to the office to hear that he’s been promoted, but is sorely disappointed of course to hear that he has not, so he isn’t feeling so good.","He gets in the elevator again and then comes back down to the fourth floor.","And then when the elevator opens, he sees Keith Reynolds, uh sorry, he sees Patrick Campbell, and Sarah kissing.","And this is just the worst thing.","So Patrick Reynolds comes into the elevator and then Keith Reynolds is feeling violent, and utters three words that we don’t learn the identity of, but it provokes a fight between them, and physical blows fall and yeah, Keith Reynolds kills Patrick Campbell.","And so there’s this kind of like a bloody cartoons in the elevator.","And then knowing that there’s blood all over the elevator, Keith Reynolds, all of this is calmly delivered in the voiceover.","Keith Reynolds pulls Patrick onto one of the floors, um and then decides to pull him down the stairs instead of being exposed with the elevator, because someone has seemingly pointed, nobody likes a murderer.","Um and then there’s another woman who’s on a lower floor who just wants to go all the way up to the seventh floor to wash her hands because it has the nice soap dispenser.","So she takes the stairs, encounters Keith Reynolds and Patrick, bloody Patrick on the stairwell, and then faints.","So then she’s now bloody too, and then Keith Reynolds proceeds, tries not to bump into her, and then he arrives on the fourth floor.","Sarah sees them, and she faints too, and then he decides, okay wow, there’s you know.","He hopes for a moment that she’ll just run into his arms and then tell him that she likes him just the way he is, but that does not happen.","She faints.","And he notices that there’s conveniently a ladder propped outside, so he pulls Patrick to the windowsill and throws him out, and then he climbs onto the um elevator.","And then he muses for a while as he’s just balanced on these like stilts, oh sorry, this ladder, and um he notices a man he’s never noticed before.","Um the man who mops the floor in the office building.","And then they lock gazes and then Keith Reynolds thinks about how um you know lots of people want the same things.","You know, nice job, beautiful wife, you know this kind of pursuit of happiness thing, he muses about this.","And um the man who mops the floor thinks about how he’s never seen such unusual sights, seeing Keith Reynolds just balancing there.","And the clip ends.","Okay I’m done."],"duration":{"_EnumKey_":[5,8,14,2,21,4,12,3,9,11,6,16,7,15,13,24,19,31,17,10,18,20],"_EnumValue_":{"_ArraySize_":168,"_ArrayType_":"uint8","_ArrayZipType_":"zlib","_ArrayZipSize_":168,"_ArrayZipData_":"eJwNxUEWwyAIBcAHEuSDSE1I73/UdjZDPOTSKcbGEBsOYliQW6zU3OoctVMS9NGziPX2/Tgm9wEg\n42Uvesy70bLZTZ1oPDG5IKKQNzZJrUDwf0Omf2sQ9yOjLqiV+9HyTWFrzTzadGuu2RMus7L/yQ/d\n/gYK\n"}}}}},

","And he finally goes in and he gets to see Leonardo di Caprio.","And it's through, he's in this little cell and it's really dingy and it's dripping.","Tom Hanks gets under his umbrella to shield himself from the dripping from the ceiling, which is a funny moment.","And he's trying to read him something through this little window into his cell.","And he's all coughing and miserable and sick and bedraggled with long beard and hair and dirty, with a blanket.","Tom Hanks is having none of it, he thinks he's conning him, he's not really sick, but eventually he just starts acting sicker and sicker and collapses.","And he calls for a doctor and gets him to get the guy out and take him to the little prison infirmary and they drop him on the bed in the prison infirmary.","And then they go out and they're talking, they leave him by himself on the bed with the sort of curtain around the bed.","They're talking about something and then they hear, you hear the door kind of close and they notice that he's gone, he's escaped from the bed.","And the scene switches to Leonardo kind of obviously still sick legitimately sick but hobbling and stumbling down some prison hallway and the prisoners are all cheering.","And they catch him and put a gun to his head and he collapses himself backwards on the floor and surrenders.","And that I guess is the story of how he was caught.","Ok that one I probably remember better than any of the others","moving on from there, the next one, I'm not sure if it was the next one, I think it was the next one, was either animated or a Claymation ","and it was of a girl and she had a box of pizza.","And she was in her room, she looked like she was, I don't know, like a young adult kind of a woman, maybe like in her 20s or something like that.","And an envelope shows up at her door and in the envelope is a record.","She puts the record on the record player and starts playing it.","Uh, trying to remember the song of the record, it was like story of life or something like that.","And as it was playing, the pizza was shrinking. She was eating the pizza but then it was shrinking.","And she pushes the record back and forth and notices that she can make the pizza appear and disappear as she pushes the record back and forth.","This record is like transporting her forward and back through time.","So she pushes it forward and sees her whole pizza disappear, pushes it backwards, sees her whole pizza reappear again.","And then the rest of the clip is her picking it up and putting it in different spots and like skipping around through her life.","So she puts it forward and she is a slightly older woman and she's pregnant.","She's putting the record back and forth and her belly is getting bigger and smaller and bigger and smaller as she's pushing the record back and forth.","And then she skips it forward a little bit more and she's standing there holding a baby.","And she picks it up and pushes it way back, and she herself is now like a toddler holding a baby doll.","And she toddles over to it, and pushes it forward and now she's old and she's in a wheelchair.","And this one's kind of funny because she's trying to get over to it in her wheelchair but the record keeps skipping.","Whenever it skips she gets reset so she'll wheel towards it, the record will skip, and so she'll jump back, wheel towards it, the record will skip, she'll jump back.","And she makes it, there's one more, I think she's old again in a walker and she's trying to get to it.","This one's kind of sad because she's racing towards it, her walker, she's not moving very fast and she can't get to it and it ends, the record ends, she plop becomes an urn sitting on the floor, and that's the end of that little clip.","I don't know which clip was the third clip so I'm just going to pick another one to go with.","And the next one I'm thinking of is probably the most similar one to that one.","It's also animated and this one was called The Rock or the Stone or something like that.","And it opens and there are some prehistoric creatures moving around in the ocean and there's a mountain and the mountain has a face on it and kind of a circular nose.","This mountain is going to be the protagonist of the clip.","And as time advances and this mountain erodes away, you see there's, they're like, dinosaurs come and go, there's a big snow with glaciers and there's wooly mammoths.","And the mountain is shrinking and it's becoming a smaller and smaller rock.","And the mountain is now like a boulder and on top of the boulder is a tree and they're some guys who are trying to cut down the tree.","And the boulder gets really disgruntled and stands up and walks into the woods to hide from these guys.","It seems like his main motivation, he just wants to sleep all the time.","So he goes into the woods and sleeps but his sleep doesn't last long because he gets pulled out of the woods by some people and gets dragged away and he becomes a millstone, one of those stones.","He's in a water wheel, attached to a water wheel, spinning around and making, I guess you use it to make grain or something like that.","He doesn't like that at all because he's now been machined to be perfectly round.","He's spinning around and he's dizzy and he's not happy about that.","Then um, what happens to the rock after that?","Oh some people come, they're like soldiers, revolutionary, like civil war, I guess they're civil war soldiers.","They come and they take the rock away and they make him into the cannon balls and he's shot, they take him on the ship, they shoot him at another ship, he breaks the mast of the Confederate ship and lands in the ocean, sinks into the ocean.","And I don't remember what happens to him after that; at some point he becomes a fossil, he's picked up by a fossil collector.","He's got some marine, ancient marine fossil inside of him.","And then he falls out of the museum and goes rolling through the city.","Someone picks him up and throws him through a window at some point.","And then at the end of it he becomes, he's eroded down, he finally becomes sand ","and the sand gets picked up and melted into glass ","and the glass is put on the front of a satellite, he's shot into space, this rock.","And something happens to the satellite, he ends up crashing on another planet, ","and the closing scene in the one about the rock is this cracked piece of glass with this rock character inside of it has become part of a mountain on another planet, that now has prehistoric life, so the plot has come full circle.","That's what I remember about the one about the rock.","What's another one.","I guess another animated one is about the colorful stick figures.","There's a colorful stick figure guy who shows up at a building full of stick figures, and the stick figure guy goes to work and he thinks he's going to get a promotion and he goes up, he gets into the elevator.","It looks kind of like a Sim tower, sort of all profile kind of a shot with the camera's panning up and down through this building.","And he gets into the elevator and he goes to the floor where his love interest, which is the pink stick figure, is.","And he offers his love interest, the pink stick figure, a cup of coffee.","He's obviously not being very successful with his love interest.","She doesn't want a cup of coffee.","She drops it out the window and it lands on a window washer guy who falls down the window.","Then our stick figure guy gets back in the elevator and heads up to the boss' office, anticipating his promotion.","And he gets to the boss' office just as green stick figure is walking out.","And the green stick figure is walking very confidently and happily because he's been given the promotion blue stick figure guy was supposed to get.","The blue stick figure guy, he goes into the office and he's told that he doesn't get his promotion.","Meanwhile, green stick figure is down with pink love interest stick figure and they're kissing down there.","And blue stick figure guy is dejected, he doesn't get his promotion, he goes out, he goes down to the floor where the pink stick figure is and he sees them.","And he is miserable, because he didn't get his promotion and his love interest is now kissing this other guy and everything is awful in his life.","And green stick figure guy comes into the elevator, into the elevator with him and they get into a fight and the blue stick figure murders the green stick figure.","That was not what he was intending to do, but he does.","And what happens after that?","He's trying to take him, he's trying to sneak him out of the building.","He doesn't want to take the elevator.","He's trying to sneak him down the stairs and as he's trying to sneak him down the stairs he runs into another stick figure person, yellow stick figure person.","Yellow stick figure person's on her way upstairs to the bathroom and she see the blue guy dragging the dead green guy and she faints and falls down the stairs, and I think she dies herself on the stairs.","So then our green guy knows that he can't take the stairs anymore or take the elevator down anymore and he sees this ladder on the window which is the ladder left by the window washer guy that fell from the coffee earlier in the story.","And so he goes out the window and I guess he just drops the green guy down.","He's on the ladder himself and he's teetering and it sort of pant back and becomes a little philosophical.","And it ends there with him teetering on the ladder outside the window and someone inside, I guess the janitor, watching him teeter.","Ok what's another one.","I think those are all of the animated ones.","The next one that comes to mind is the one with the guy at the copier and the black hole.","So he prints, something weird is happening with the copier machine, he's trying to copy something, and out comes this page and on the page is this big black circle.","It's printed.","And that's wasn't what he wanted so he puts it down and tries to copy this other thing.","He goes to put his coffee cup down, the coffee cup falls through the black circle.","It's one of those like Acme instant holes in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, it's kind of a hole where you can just reach through.","So he reaches his arm inside and his arm disappears and he goes through and he's able to grab his coffee cup from down below.","So he's surprised and interested by this thing so he goes to the vending machine and he slaps the hole on the vending machine, reaches his arm through, and gets a candy bar from the vending machine.","And so he gets a really good idea.","He goes over to the money room, puts the hole on the door, reaches through the hole, and he opens the door from the other side which is locked.","And he goes to the safe, and he puts his hole on the safe and he's reaching through and taking money out of the safe.","And he's taking money out of the safe, taking money out of the safe, and very pleased with himself.","And then to get the last little bit of money he's reaching his arm further and further and further and he ends up crawling, putting his whole arm in, then his whole head in, and his whole body through the hole.","And then, the paper falls and he's stuck inside the safe.","And it ends with that guy stuck inside of the safe sort of banging, banging and trying to get out.","Um, what's another story.","Another story is the robot boyfriend story.","I think it was called High Maintenance or something like that.","And in the robot boyfriend story there's a couple, they're at dinner, and there's not a lot of conversation happening, they're not that happy.","The lady, the girl tries to pour the guy some wine and he refuses the wine and they're still not talking, and it's a very awkward, sort of those long, long tables, and they're very far away from each other.","He says he can't have wine because he's on call.","She's complaining about what a boring guy he is.","He's definitely, his characterization is that he is a pretty boring guy.","So she snaps and she complains, she says it's not, today is their anniversary, this is not how I wanted to spend my anniversary right here with this boring guy, I think mechanical slow sex.","And so she goes up to him and she apologizes and says I didn't mean it.","And she reaches a switch on the back of his neck and she turns him off.","He's turned off there at the table.","She goes to her computer, she's on like an online catalogue of robot boyfriends and she finds a much better robot boyfriend.","She calls the robot company and says I'm not satisfied with my robot boyfriend, he's really boring, he's got no sense of adventure, so I'd like an upgrade, an upgraded one.","So she orders an upgraded one, who's like a rock climber masseuse or something like that.","The new one shows up, the old one goes away.","Then they're back, they're sitting at dinner with the new robot boyfriend.","And there's some dialogue that's repeated from the first conversation, something about asparagus, where he's now taking her role.","And he goes over and he's giving her a massage and he turns her off.","And then he goes over to the TV and it ends with him smoking a cigarette, drinking a beer, eating chips, and watching football on the television or something.","That's the parallelism of it.","And, what's another story?","Well I can remember the last story.","In the last story there's a guy, and he's standing waiting for a bus, and he's wearing headphones.","And he's got a bag, I think he's got ice cream or something in the bag, a grocery bag.","And he looks really hot and miserable and sweaty.","And a car pulls up really fast, slams on the brakes, and comes to a really fast stop next to a payphone.","And a lady gets out of the car, she goes over to the payphone and she's obviously distraught about something with this payphone.","The payphone's not working so she comes across the street to the guy and she asks to borrow his phone.","And as that's happening her car starts to roll away, which is funny, because she doesn't notice and nobody else in the story notices that her car is rolling away but I really think it was rolling away.","So she asks him for his phone, and he agrees to let her use his phone, and she makes some phone call, and it sounds like she's talking to a mobster or something.","She's threatening to go to the police and she's distraught and she's angry and she ends up throwing the phone on the ground and breaking the phone.","She says I'm here, yeah that's what she says when she picks up the phone, yeah she says I'm here.","And so the guy, and then she goes and she's just standing in the road and the guy whose phone it was picks up the phone and he's mad because she broke his phone.","He's actually not that mad, he's just confused and awkward.","Hey, uh miss, I think you, this phone is broken.","Can I, could you give me some money for my phone that you broke?","She's not really paying attention to him at all.","Then a car pulls up and stops and a guy gets out in a I don't know like fancy suit sort of an outfit.","He goes and he's having a conversation with the lady, an angry one, what's she asking.","She's like, where is she?","Where is she, she wants to know.","Then the guy in the car is asking her, so the guy with the phone has been following her trying to get her to pay attention and give him money for his phone and he says, who is this, goes, you know who I am?","He recognizes him, he's a magician from, he says the magician from the casino.","And then at some point I don't know if this was before or after this, the lady pulls out a gun and she's threatening the guy and she wants to know where is she, tell me now.","The magician pulls out a little, with some slight of hand pulls out a little magic gun.","So they're threatening each other.","At some point then the lady goes around to the magician guy's car and she's trying to get to the trunk.","At the same time the magician guy has started kind of hypnotizing the phone guy.","He's got some little box which is like a coffin and it's got some bones inside and he's reading some magic words.","And the phone guy, he's getting delirious and he passes out, his ice cream is melted, splattered on the ground next to him.","He's passed out on the road.","And as that happens the magician goes shit and he pulls out of his pocket a little piece of paper, I guess it's got the magic words on it, and he's repeating them muttering the magic words under his breath like he did something wrong.","And in the meantime the lady has gotten open the trunk of the car and is looking appalled at what she sees in there and hears barking coming from inside.","And then the phone guy wakes up and the phone guy has become a dog, barking, and he's walking around on all fours.","And the lady comes over and sees him, she's on the ground, the dog guy's on the ground, the magician guy's on the ground.","She shoots the magician guy and the magician guy shoots her and phone guy has now become a dog barking, he's walking around on all fours.","Out of the trunk comes another girl, who's also a dog, I guess the one the first lady was asking about.","So now they're both dogs and they're acting like dogs and they're like sniffing each other and barking at each other.","And they walk off together under the bridge and that's the end of that one.","I am missing a lot of them.","So there's one called the Village or the Prisoner or something like that.","It looks like it's from, it's a Wizard of Oz style cinematography, so it's an older movie I think.","And there's a guy and he's sort of confused about where he is.","He's at a cafe and he's trying to ask the lady, the cafe lady, what village he's in and where the village is, and she's totally confused.","But she directs him to a place where he can make a phone call, and he picks up the phone, and it's sort of a weird looking phone, it's not a payphone, it's a cordless phone, sitting there.","He talks to the, there's an operator on the other side of the phone, he wants to know where he is and she won't tell him, she just wants to know what is his number.","He says he doesn't have a number and she says no number, no phone call, hangs up on him.","Then he finds some kind of a board with buttons on it and it's got a map of the village that says the village and he pushes a button for a taxi and the taxi lady shows up.","He's trying to get the taxi lady to tell him where he is, or can she take him out of the village, and she says no, it's a local taxi only and so he says take me as far as you can and gets into the taxi and they go.","Then she goes as far as she can which is not that far.","And then, he goes into a shop, and there's a shopkeeper there and he's talking to the shopkeeper, the shopkeeper's talking in Italian or something to a lady and they switch to English as he walks in.","And then he walks into the shop and he asks the shopkeeper for a map.","And the shop guy asks him if it's a color or black and white map he wants, and he doesn't care, he just wants a map.","So he gets a map and the map is just a map of one village.","It's a very small village, it's only got a couple buildings in it and around it it's just really vague, it just says the mountains, the mountains, the sea, there's no details.","So he asks for a larger map and after a bunch of fuss the guy gets him out a larger map which is colored this time, and the larger map doesn't show any bigger area, it's just a physically larger map but exactly the same thing.","And I think that's the end of that one.","I guess it's the beginning of some movie where he's trapped in this you know weird Twilight Zone sort of a situation.","I know I'm forgetting a lot of these.","Trying to remember more.","There’s catch me if you can, there’s that Claymation one, the pizza.","What came after that?","Uh, I don't know, I think I only remembered about half of them.","I don't know, I'm not remembering anymore, I guess I'm done.","I guess I'm ready to see the titles."],"duration":{"_EnumKey_":[10,9,3,7,4,11,13,5,6,8,14,17,16,2,12,1],"_EnumValue_":{"_ArraySize_":203,"_ArrayType_":"uint8","_ArrayZipType_":"zlib","_ArrayZipSize_":203,"_ArrayZipData_":"eJwNjdEOA0EIAqPALnqt1///2srTJBAmEkwdJe6xi+6+3U9JgZSK229UdvtTcuqqrVOQ60sJhvVg\nFGFriltn8xUwPEfNUeUP6s5hKUQIcQZ+jQWjev0zWqLylHL9CM68a1VVEbeZDBf2IpPOF7HivpMz\nnt3/Afn1BRM=\n"}}}}},

I didn’t know any other way to make it.”","And then she asks, she asks number one that, and then she asks number two, she goes like, “How’d you get caught?” and he says it’s this guy Carl.","And then it sort of flashes back to this like rainy scene outside a prison in Marseilles.","And Tom Hanks is there, I guess he’s Carl, and they're talking to the French guys who run the jail.","And they wanna get in and see the, the con man who’s in prison there.","And so they are trying to talk to them, and then they finally get let into this really sort of dreary prison.","And they get let in, and then they go up to the jail cell where he is at the end of the hallway, and Tom Hanks is trying to read the articles of extradition.","And Leo Dicaprio’s character is like coughing in the back corner.","And he’s like, “You're not gonna fool me, ‘cause you think I’m gonna be fooled,” and he’s coughing and coughing, and then he collapses.","And then Tom Hanks starts screaming for a doctor.","So they get him out of the jail cell, and they bring him up to the hospital.","And he’s asking the guys about the doctor, and he says like, “Don’t ruin it for me. I’ve been chasing this guy forever.”","And then they say, as they're talking, “The doctor will be there tomorrow,” and as they're talking, I guess Leo Dicaprio’s character escapes through the door.","And they look at the empty bed, and the door is ajar, and so they go through the door, and Leo Dicaprio’s character’s running down the hallway, and all the prisoners are up on the second level screaming.","And he's like collapsing ‘cause he’s really sick, and he's falling, but he's trying to run.","And then he collapses, and the guards and Tom Hanks catch up to him, and one of the guards puts a gun to his head.","And then he sort of gives up and falls on the floor with his arms up, and he says like, “Alright, take me home.”","And then there was a clip about the, this girl’s eating a pizza,","and she gets a package outside the door, and it’s a record, and so she puts on the record.","And as she spins the record forward, like time passes, and her pizza’s half eaten.","And she spins the record forward more, and more time passes, and like the whole box is eaten and the candle goes down.","And then she spins the record back, and it undoes that.","And so she keeps spinning it forward and back.","And so then she spins it forward and she’s pregnant.","Then she spins it back and she's not pregnant, and forward and she's pregnant again, and then forward a bit more and she's holding a baby, and the baby starts screaming.","So she screams for, she spins it forward more.","And then she's in a wheelchair with her leg broken.","And she's trying to reach it to spin it, the record, but she can't reach it, because she keeps getting electrocuted or something.","And then she, it goes backward, and she's trying to reach it, she can't reach it, and she falls backwards.","And then she gets really old, ‘cause I guess the record jumped, and she's in a walker and she's really old.","She's trying to get to the record, and she can't.","And then the record skips ahead again, and it’s, she's in an urn, and the lid is like, you know, bouncing or something.","And then there's a Boyfriend clip, where there’s this woman, and she's eating dinner and having sort of stilted conversation with this guy, and they're at opposite ends of the table.","And she's trying to offer him wine, and he's like, “You know I can’t drink wine when I'm on call.”","And she says, she drinks, and she's not happy about that, and so she drinks a lot of wine.","Or she finishes her cup of wine, and then she pours herself more.","And then she spills, like throws wine on his face.","And they're talking about the asparagus and how it’s tender, and she says, “It’s an aphrodisiac,” and he says, “Who says that?”","And then she, so yeah, she spills wine on his head, and she gets upset.","And then he starts lighting a cigarette.","And she is like, “Don’t smoke in my house,” and then she puts out his cigarette, and he lights another one.","And then she like screams at him, like, you know, something about their relationship and how it’s unhappy, and they’ve like, quick, short mechanical sex.","And then she sits on his lap, and she's like apologizing.","I guess tonight’s their anniversary.","And so she's like sort of upset on his lap.","Then she reaches around his neck and flips this switch.","And then she gets on her computer, and she's looking at all these models of male sort of robots.","And she calls the help line, and she sort of complains about the 100 model.","And the help line, and she says like, you know, “He lacks ambition, and he is,” I forget the other thing, but she, the help line lady says, you know, “That’s a problem with these, this model.”","And so she says, you know, “We could upgrade you,” and she says, “Yeah, I’d like to be upgraded to a rock climber masseuse, with less of a beard and shorter hair.”","And so then they deliver her her new like robotic man, I guess like very realistic robotic man.","And he's the one she like requested.","And so he comes in, and the other guy gets wheeled out, who’s like shut down, and then new guy hasn’t been activated yet.","And as they're wheeling out the old guy, she, you sort of see the picture frame of their wedding, and she runs toward him and kisses him and then takes off his wedding ring, and then slips it on the new boyfriend.","And, or husband I guess, and then they sit down at dinner, and you know he slowly comes to life.","And so he grabs the napkin in sort of a clunky manner, and then she is sitting across the table, and he asks if she wants, if he wants wine, and she says, he says no, because he has a climb tomorrow.","And then she, she says, she sort of looks upset, because she kind of wanted a boyfriend that would drink with her.","And then he says, you know, “Asparagus is an aphrodisiac.”","And she says, “Who says that?” and he says, “I don’t know.”","And then he comes over to her, and he starts massaging her and asking about her day.","And she says she got lunch with Anna, and then she got stuff for dinner tonight, since it’s their anniversary.","And she, and then as he's massaging her, he switches off her switch, ‘cause it turns out she’s a robot too.","And then he goes down and sits and watches TV and smokes a cigarette.","And then there's the Shoe clip, where there's a zoomed in picture of the shoe.","And then this guy is walking, and everything he does, the girl sort of copies.","And as they're walking down the street, you know, he sort of waves, and she waves back, and then he sort of like, you know, walks funny, and she walks funny, ","and then she walks down behind this sort of like box, and she's hidden from view, and he copies her then.","And then she walks to the intersection, and she sort of like waves at him to stop, but he doesn’t get it, and he like waves back at her and keeps going, ‘cause he's like mimicking her.","And then he gets hit by a car, and he likes cracks the windshield.","And then the car like goes airborne, and then the car flips over and crashes, and the window pane falls out.","And then there’s Keith Reynolds, and it says, “Keith Reynolds can't make it tonight.”","And um ","then he, there's a cartoon, and he's like going into work.","And he wants a promotion.","And he says, and he's riding up the elevator, and he says he's the most junior, or most senior junior businessman, and he is riding up the elevator.","And today’s the day when he wants to get a promotion, and he wants the promotion, ‘cause there's this girl that he likes.","And so as he walks in through the entryway, there's people like tossing paper into the trashcan, and I guess there's a, someone sitting at the desk.","And he goes up to the floor where there's a lady who is the one he likes, and he always gives her coffee.","I think it’s Sara is the girl’s name.","And he gives her coffee, but apparently she doesn’t like coffee, so she throws it out the window, and it hits the guy who I think is cleaning the windows.","And he falls down, and then a guy on the floor below, like HR guy, sees the guy fall down past the window, and he like doesn’t know what it is, so he looks out the window, and he sees someone on the ground, so he calls an ambulance.","And so then Keith Richards goes up to another floor on the elevator, or another couple floors to see about his promotion.","And the guy who’s in there right before is getting a promotion, and so he's get a really firm handshake, and he's signing with this pen.","And then Keith, sorry Reynolds, gets out of the elevator, and the other guy gets in, and he rides down, and the other guy like rides down and gets with Sara, ‘cause Sara would want the guy to get the promotion.","Whereas like Keith is, goes into the meeting about the promotion, and the handshake is not as firm as he thought it would be, and he doesn’t see the pen.","He doesn’t think he's gonna get the promotion, and he doesn’t, but the other guy who got it is like making out with Sara.","And then Keith is all sort of dejected, and he rides down to see Sara, and he's like, “Maybe I’ll get her another coffee.”","And the guy’s like, and when the elevator door opens, he sees the other guy making out with Sara, and then the guy gets in the elevator with him.","And then as Keith gets off the elevator, he says something to the guy that he's never said to anyone before.","Then the other guy gets upset, and he like punches Keith, and he's wondering if he's gonna be bruised tomorrow.","Then he punches back, and he like beats the other guy up, and the other guy falls down, and then he like swings like his briefcase into the other guy’s head, and he kills the guy.","And then he drags, then he’s trying to realize what to do with the dead body, and this other woman wants, has to go upstairs for some reason, I forget why.","And the guy, and you think she's gonna take the elevator, but then apparently she had a New Year’s resolution, so she takes up the stairs.","Then Keith’s like, he doesn’t wanna ride the elevator, ‘cause somebody could call the elevator, and then he’d see him with this dead body and all bloody and stuff.","And so he drags him down the stairs, and so they run into this lady.","And then she, as she's walking up the stairs, on the sixth floor or something, then she falls back when she sees Keith dragging this dead body.","And then she hits her head, and she dies, and he's like, “That was an accident.”","And then he keeps going, and then he's like, “Maybe I shouldn’t walk down the stairs,” and so he's gonna go out through the window, ‘cause he sees a ladder there, which is the ladder that that other guy fell off of.","And so as he's going up the ladder, then Sara comes to see this guy she likes, I think his name is Sam maybe.","And she sees the dead body, and Keith dragging it, and she faints, but she doesn’t die, because she's not near the stairs.","And then he throws the other guy out the window, and then he is on the ladder.","And there's this new guy who’s like mopping the floor, and he sees him, and Keith’s like balancing on the ladder.","And then there's a clip about a rock.","And the rock starts out like a
