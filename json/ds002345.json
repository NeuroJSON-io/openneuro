"README":"Narratives: fMRI data for evaluating models of naturalistic language comprehension\n\nThe \"Narratives\" collection aggregates auditory story-listening fMRI datasets acquired over the course of roughly seven years (2011–2018). Stimuli comprised 28 naturalistic spoken stories ranging from ~3 to ~56 minutes for a total of ~5 hours of unique audio stimuli. The collection includes 315 unique subjects participating in over 750 functional scans with accompanying anatomical data. This re-release of the dataset follows on ds002245 v.1.0.3 and fixes some issues with cropped and redundant T1w anatomical images.\n\nPlease contact Sam Nastase if you observe any irregularities in the dataset.\n\nSamuel A.

The goal of these publicly-funded, strictly non-commercial scholarly research studies was to better understand how humans process natural language and comprehend complex narratives. Unfortunately, at the time of study design, we were not aware of sufficient publicly available high-quality collection of suitable clips which was in the public domain or released under free licenses, and thus had to compile our own set of stimuli for the studies. The audio clips are, however, freely available online at their respective sources. To facilitate reproducibility and promote the replicabilion of our scientific findings, and to add to the scientific value of the neuroimaging datasets associated with this study which we have released publicly, we were prompted to share this stimulus dataset. The studies for which this stimulus dataset was compiled were publicly funded by the National Institute of Mental Health at the National Institutes of Health (grant numbers R01-MH094480, DP1-HD091948, R01-MH112566, R01-MH112357, T32-MH065214), which has developed policies promoting data sharing:\n\nhttps://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/\n\nThis stimulus dataset is intended for non-profit, non-commercial scholarship and research use under \"fair use\" or \"fair dealing\" provisions, and (re)sharing and use of these media files is intended to respect the following guidelines:\n\nhttps://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html\n\nIf you are the rightful owner of any of the material present in the dataset, and would like us to stop sharing your material, please email us (sam.nastase@gmail.com) and we will stop sharing those clips.\n","santa_audio.wav":{"_DataLink_":"https://neurojson.org/io/stat.cgi?action=get&db=openneuro&doc=ds002345&file=stimuli/santa_audio.wav&size=33751118"},"seinfeld_audio.wav":{"_DataLink_":"https://neurojson.org/io/stat.cgi?action=get&db=openneuro&doc=ds002345&file=stimuli/seinfeld_audio.wav&size=33374286"},"shame_audio.wav":{"_DataLink_":"https://neurojson.org/io/stat.cgi?action=get&db=openneuro&doc=ds002345&file=stimuli/shame_audio.wav&size=33661006"},"shapesphysical_audio.wav":{"_DataLink_":"https://neurojson.org/io/stat.cgi?action=get&db=openneuro&doc=ds002345&file=stimuli/shapesphysical_audio.wav&size=87846990"},"shapessocial_audio.wav":{"_DataLink_":"https://neurojson.org/io/stat.cgi?action=get&db=openneuro&doc=ds002345&file=stimuli/shapessocial_audio.wav&size=87846990"},"sherlock_audio.wav":{"_DataLink_":"https://neurojson.org/io/stat.cgi?action=get&db=openneuro&doc=ds002345&file=stimuli/sherlock_audio.wav&size=34598124"},"slumlordreach_audio.wav":{"_DataLink_":"https://neurojson.org/io/stat.cgi?action=get&db=openneuro&doc=ds002345&file=stimuli/slumlordreach_audio.wav&size=317806028"},"tunnel_audio.wav":{"_DataLink_":"https://neurojson.org/io/stat.cgi?action=get&db=openneuro&doc=ds002345&file=stimuli/tunnel_audio.wav&size=135278558"},"upintheair_audio.wav":{"_DataLink_":"https://neurojson.org/io/stat.cgi?action=get&db=openneuro&doc=ds002345&file=stimuli/upintheair_audio.wav&size=36016206"},"vinny_audio.wav":{"_DataLink_":"https://neurojson.org/io/stat.cgi?action=get&db=openneuro&doc=ds002345&file=stimuli/vinny_audio.wav&size=34373710"}},
