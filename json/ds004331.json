"README":"This dataset contains the raw fMRI data accompanying the paper \"The spatiotemporal neural dynamics of object recognition for natural images and line drawings\" (Link to preprint: https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.08.12.503484v1). Please cite the above paper if you use this data.\n\nThe dataset includes:\n\n1. anat/ anatomical scans (T1-weighted images) for each subject (except for sub-23)\n2. func/ whole-brain EPI data from 13 runs (1 localizer, 12 main experiment) for each participant. The events files contain the onsets, durations and trial types for all trials in the corresponding run.\n\nFor a full description of the paradigm and the employed procedures please see the paper.  \n\nResults for the first-level analyses for this data can be found on OSF (https://osf.io/vsc6y/). Code for the analysis of the data can be found on Github (https://github.com/Singerjohannes/object_drawing_dynamics/). \n\n\n",
