"README":"README \r\n\r\nMusic Genre fMRI Dataset by Tomoya Nakai, Naoko Koide-Majima, and Shinji Nishimoto\r\n\nReferences:\n Nakai, Koide-Majima, and Nishimoto (2021). Correspondence of categorical and feature-based representations of music in the human brain. Brain and Behavior. 11(1), e01936. https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.1936\n\r\nWe measured brain activity using functional MRI while five subjects (“sub-001”, …, “sub-005”) listened to music stimuli of 10 different genres.\r\n\r\nThe entire folder consists of subject-wise subfolders (“sub-001”,…). Each subject’s folder contains the following subfolders:\r\n1) anat: T1-weighted structural images\r\n2) func: functional signals (multi-band echo-planar images)\r\n\r\nEach subject performed 18 runs consisting of 12 training runs and 6 test runs. The training and test data were assigned with the following notations:\r\n Training data: sub-00*_task-Training_run-**_bold.json\r\n Test data: sub-00*_task-Test_run-**_bold.json\r\n\r\nEach *_event.tsv file contains following information:\r\n onset: stimulus onset\n Duration: stimulus duration\r\n genre: genre type (out of 10 genres)\n track: index to identify the original track\n start: onset of excerpt from the original track (second)\n end: offset of excerpt from the original track (second)\r\n\nThe duration of all stimuli is 15s.　For each clip, 2 s of fade-in and fade-out effects were applied, and the overall signal intensity was normalized in terms of the root mean square.\n\nFor the training runs, the 1st stimulus (0-15s) is the same as the last stimulus of the previous run (600-615s). For the test runs, the1st stimulus (0-15s) is the same as the last stimulus of the same run (600-615s). \n\nThe original music stimuli (GTZAN dataset) can be found here:\nhttp://marsyas.info/downloads/datasets.html\r\n\r\n***Caution***\r\nThis dataset can be used for research purposes only. The data were anonymized, and users shall not perform analyses to re-identify individual subjects.\r\n\r\n",
